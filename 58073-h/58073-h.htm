<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Death In the Clouds</i></span></h2>
<p>The girl with wind-blown hair ordered the coolie pushing
a cart loaded with instruments and strange radio-like
boxes to come close to the big anti-aircraft gun and leave
the cart there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You runnee this-a wire backee and fixee him plenty
good.&rdquo; She handed the coolie a long electric cord. The
coolie vanished into the shadows of the palm trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big idea?&rdquo; The sergeant in command of
the anti-aircraft gun sat up. The air of India was hot and
moist that afternoon. He had been half asleep. Now he
stared at the cart and its odd contents and then sent a
second questioning look at the girl with the wind-blown
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I are going to do a little practicing.&rdquo; The girl
spoke in a steady even tone. Then she smiled.</p>
<p>The sergeant looked her up and down. She was, he decided
one of those rare girls who could make even the
drab uniform of a WAC look good. She was rather large
but well proportioned. &ldquo;An oversize copy of a beautiful
gal,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>To the girl, after recalling her words, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Says who?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Says the Colonel.&rdquo; Smiling a little more broadly she
fished a crumpled bit of paper from her pocket and
handed it to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Military papers,&rdquo; he grumbled as he smoothed out the
sheet. &ldquo;Should be kept in perfect condition, folded neatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And read.&rdquo; She did not smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay&mdash;okay, sister. All the same, that&rsquo;s general orders
I&rsquo;m giving you. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off to stare at the paper. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; He
glared at the paper some more. &ldquo;You are to send small
balloons carrying hollow steel balls up into the sky. Then
you are to find them up there in the clouds and I am
to try and shoot them down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? A new game for a soldier&rsquo;s pastime in a
strange and foreign land?&rdquo; He stared at her afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever hear of radar?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! They use it in the Navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do. And they&rsquo;ll use it in the Army too, providing
it is possible to get the co-operation of the Army sergeants
in charge of anti-aircraft guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning me? Okay. You win,&rdquo; he agreed with an
unwilling grin. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one line in this paper that is
coo-coo. It should say that you are to try and find those
steel balls in the clouds and I&rsquo;m to shoot &rsquo;em down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo; She stood her ground.</p>
<p>The coolie returned with one end of the electric cord.
She connected it to the box on the cart. Something began
to burn. Some tubes lighted up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? That thing? I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The weather,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible!&rdquo; he agreed with conviction. &ldquo;Just at the end
of the rainy season! It&rsquo;s awful having your rest period
broken into by a gal in an army uniform.&rdquo; He winked at
the two buck privates who helped man his gun, and they
laughed.</p>
<p>Paying not the least attention to this unflattering bit
of drama, the girl went about her work. Removing a short
steel tube from the cart, she connected it with a large
paper balloon, then turned on a valve. A hissing sound
followed. The balloon inflated rapidly and pulled at the
cord that held it to the cart. After attaching a metal ball
about a foot in diameter to the balloon, she allowed it
to float skyward. It rose rapidly.</p>
<p>Squinting his eyes, the sergeant said: &ldquo;You expect me
to hit that steel ball after it gets into the clouds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your shell explodes within fifteen feet of the balloon
the balloon will burst and the steel ball will come down,&rdquo;
she explained with the patient tone of a born teacher.
&ldquo;If you burst the balloon, you score. Hit the steel ball and
you score double. Get me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure. But when do you score?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you score, I score.&rdquo; Her smile was broad and friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; the sergeant grinned. &ldquo;Well, boys, we&rsquo;ll
give it a real try, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Oh, sure!&rdquo; came from his crew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The balloon went up. In silence they watched it rise
to at last disappear in the clouds.</p>
<p>At once the girl with wind-blown hair got busy with
her instruments. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling for the steel ball,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s feeling for the steel ball,&rdquo; one of the buck private
gunners repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have it presently,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Like h&mdash;l,&rdquo;
he muttered, under his breath.</p>
<p>The eyes of the gun crew were on the girl. It was as if
she had learned some Hindu magic there in India. They
questioned that she could do the trick, but gave her the
benefit of the doubt, nevertheless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like making a boy climb a rope into the
sky,&rdquo; one of them suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh huh. Probably,&rdquo; the other agreed. &ldquo;I saw an old guy
do that trick once. And say! Was it spookey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the boy come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I saw, he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The two buck privates
settled back in their places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; the girl sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got it,&rdquo; one of the privates repeated. The other
was silent. He had seen magic work. A boy had gone up a
rope and hadn&rsquo;t come down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me how your gun is adjusted,&rdquo; the girl said to
the sergeant. He showed her, carefully&mdash;painstakingly
as if she were a child. She grinned, but said nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;The balloon is drifting south by southeast,&mdash;three
miles an hour,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it again. Then
I&rsquo;ll set your gun on the spot. Your job is to follow the drift
and shoot the balloon down after a sixty second wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; The sergeant waited. There was an odd grin
on his face.</p>
<p>The girl bent to her task. Then suddenly she straightened
up. Her keen eyes had detected a movement in the
shadow of the palm trees. A dozen paces away she saw a
man, a black dwarf, with strangely bowed legs and a
grotesquely dried up face. Her first impulse was to say:
&ldquo;You go away!&rdquo; She did not say it, but returned to her
task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she sighed once more, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the steel ball&rsquo;s
location. I&rsquo;ll set your gun.&rdquo; This task she performed with
speed and accuracy. The boys of the gun crew watched in
some surprise. One whistled softly through his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows about guns,&rdquo; the other whispered. &ldquo;What
d&rsquo;you know about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now.&rdquo; The girl straightened up to fix her eyes on the
sergeant. &ldquo;You take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant took over. The girl held a watch on him.
The sergeant was on the spot. A girl had offered him a
challenge. As a gentleman he had accepted the challenge.
His face tensed as the seconds&mdash;one, two, three, four, five&mdash;ticked
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; came from the girl in a hoarse whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The sergeant&rsquo;s fingers moved like triggers. Instantly
the gun boomed. They waited one, two, three, four, five
seconds. Then came the dull roar of the exploding shell.</p>
<p>They waited again&mdash;one, two, three, four, five&mdash;up to
the count of twenty. Fragments of the shell could be
heard dropping. And then, at the edge of the cloud appeared
a gray shadow that rapidly developed into a black
ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By thunder! They got that balloon in the bag!&rdquo; one of
the boys exclaimed.</p>
<p>Turning about, the sergeant held out his hand to the
girl. She took it, man to man, a good hearty grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said one of the privates, &ldquo;is better than the boy
chinning the rope. You&rsquo;d ought to go in for magic, Miss.
There&rsquo;s money in magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled, but made no reply. She glanced away
at the shadows of the palm tree. The black dwarf was still
there. Not knowing why, she shuddered, but she still did
not tell him to go away.</p>
<p>The steel ball reached earth some distance away. The
first gunner, still a bit of a skeptic, ran over to retrieve it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never touched the steel ball!&rdquo; he called on the
way back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he got the balloon!&rdquo; the girl insisted. &ldquo;That was
very good indeed for the first try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&mdash;O&mdash;Thanks.&rdquo; The sergeant made a bow.
&ldquo;Sometimes the Captain says I&rsquo;m good and sometimes he
says I&rsquo;m&mdash;well, never mind just what he says. It&rsquo;s not fit
language for a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no lady,&rdquo; the girl laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a soldier, a
WAC. So let&rsquo;s just be nice and natural. Shall we have
another try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sure! As many as you like.&rdquo; The sergeant adjusted
his gun.</p>
<p>A telephone attached to a tree jangled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo; The first gunner jumped up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you, Sergeant,&rdquo; he announced a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be right there.&rdquo; The sergeant was away.</p>
<p>There was a serious, all but stern look on the sergeant&rsquo;s
face when he returned. &ldquo;Sorry, lady,&rdquo; he half apologized.
&ldquo;School&rsquo;s dismissed for today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>He broke in: &ldquo;Some nasty old Jap bombers are headed
this way to mess things up a bit. And did they pick on a
swell day to do their stuff! They&rsquo;ll come hopping out of
the clouds, drop their bombs and drop back into the clouds
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we get a good crack at &rsquo;em,&rdquo; the first gunner
broke in. &ldquo;The dirty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, you&rsquo;d better scram,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;This is
no place for you right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear &rsquo;em comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; The second gunner&rsquo;s ears were
covered by a listening device.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving,&rdquo; the girl said, as she shook her hair
into a tangled mass. &ldquo;This may be a man&rsquo;s war, but they&rsquo;ll
have to put me in the guard house to keep me out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Miss! I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the sergeant exclaimed, &ldquo;but
orders are orders. No ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s giving the orders?&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
sergeant. I&rsquo;m a second officer of the WACS. You tell me
who&rsquo;s ranking officer on this gun! I&rsquo;m staying! And we&rsquo;re
going to get one of those bombers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get what? Get&mdash;&rdquo; A strange light shone in the sergeant&rsquo;s
eyes like the glint of a diamond. &ldquo;Last time they
got a whole gun crew and one was my particular pal,&rdquo; he
grumbled. He whistled a bar of &ldquo;Lady Be Good&rdquo;, then
said: &ldquo;Have it your own way. Let&rsquo;s get set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the enemy planes could be heard rumbling
through the overcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re heading for the airdrome. We&rsquo;re practically
on the edge of it,&rdquo; the sergeant explained. &ldquo;They may take
time to wipe us off the map first,&rdquo; he added as a comforting
afterthought.</p>
<p>If the girl heard, she made no sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll circle over the place first, won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she
asked in a matter-of-fact voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they most generally do,&rdquo; the sergeant
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll get them,&rdquo; she murmured, as she
adjusted her radar set. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got one-track minds,
those Jap pilots have. They circle about in the same track
two or three times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will make it nice,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;Practically
no trouble at all. Shoot &rsquo;em down like clay pigeons right
out of those thick clouds.&rdquo; To him one toy balloon shot
out of those clouds meant very little just then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come,&rdquo; the gunner with the earphones announced.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re headed right this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably got one of those cute little maps with an X
marking the spot!&rdquo; the sergeant grumbled. Then his voice
rose. &ldquo;All right, you guys. Get set to do your stuff. They&rsquo;re
practically over us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tense seconds ticked themselves away, and then the
girl who had been working and looking toward the clouds
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re beginning to circle now, at an altitude of three
thousand feet. They&rsquo;re off to the right a quarter of a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her figure stiffened. One of the privates thought she
looked like Washington at Valley Forge. He drew a long
sharp breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming in closer,&rdquo; she said ten seconds later. &ldquo;Now
an eighth of a mile away. They&rsquo;re coming down slowly.
About twenty-five hundred up now&mdash;and almost directly
over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; the first gunner exclaimed. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we have
a try at them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many more times will they circle?&rdquo; she asked,
turning to the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&mdash;&rdquo; The sergeant&rsquo;s voice sounded dry. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t almost always tell. Three is a perfect number. You
might count on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a go,&rdquo; the girl agreed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be down to
fifteen hundred feet by then. We&rsquo;ll check on their second
circle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just to see if it&rsquo;s the same as the first?&rdquo; The sergeant
began taking short steps back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; the girl agreed coolly. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re
half way &rsquo;round&mdash;two thirds. There!&rdquo; Her voice rose.
&ldquo;They passed over at exactly the same spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fo&mdash;four of them,&rdquo; the second gunner announced with
a slight stutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get one of them, maybe two,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;My
father was a Kentucky sheriff. He packed two guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; She was on her toes. &ldquo;Everybody ready?&rdquo; Her
voice was husky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll count one, two, three. Fire on three
and keep on firing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&mdash;Okay,&rdquo; the sergeant stammered.</p>
<p>Seconds passed, one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;up to
fifteen,&mdash;and then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;Fire!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice rose high.</p>
<p>The gun roared and kept on roaring. All was wild
excitement until all of a sudden the sergeant shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody duck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an air raid shelter three jumps from the
gun. They landed in a heap, the four of them, at the very
center of the shelter. And then came a terrific roar. At once
all manner of things began falling on the shelter. One
was so heavy it seemed it might come through, but it
stayed outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the girl breathed, once they had unscrambled
themselves. &ldquo;How terrible! We missed them and they
dropped a block buster.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the sergeant roared. &ldquo;Nothing like that! We
didn&rsquo;t miss them. We got one, maybe more. That little
noise you heard outside was a Jap plane in a crash with
all its bombs still in the bomb bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Good!&rdquo; The girl tried to stand up, bumped her
head, then sat down dizzily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ease,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;Our work&rsquo;s done. They&rsquo;d
be out of range by now. They might drop a bomb or two,
but I doubt it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful! Marvelous!
You can join our outfit any time you say. What&rsquo;s your
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never guess, so I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face was a study. She had won her first battle
with the men of the Army. Did she want to laugh or cry?
Who could tell. &ldquo;My name is Gale,&rdquo; she said after an
inner struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale&mdash;the girl with the wind-blown hair,&rdquo; the sergeant
murmured. &ldquo;Not bad. But at times I imagine Typhoon
would be better. You should get a medal for this day&rsquo;s
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;&mdash;her voice dropped&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not get a medal. Know
what I&rsquo;ll get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What?&rdquo; He stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a reprimand for not ducking the moment the
raid was announced. After that probably I&rsquo;ll get sent back
to Texas to run a radio in an army camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like that!&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Something like that.&rdquo; Her voice rose. &ldquo;This is a
man&rsquo;s war. That&rsquo;s what they say. Oh yeah? What about
those Russian girls fighting in the trenches? What about
the women and children killed by air raids in England?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work far back of the lines.&rdquo; Her voice dropped.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s fine, and it really helps. Perhaps
life can be fun without excitement for some people, but
not for me.&rdquo; She sank back to her place on the cold bare
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sister, don&rsquo;t give up hope.&rdquo; The sergeant&rsquo;s voice
was husky. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real sport. The Colonel in charge of
this man&rsquo;s army over here ain&rsquo;t just like everybody else.
He&rsquo;s different. You&rsquo;ll see! He&rsquo;ll fix things up. We&rsquo;ll march
together yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo; She gripped his hand. &ldquo;And now, can
we go out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; the sergeant agreed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out and
collect a few souvenirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girl turned to creep out at the far end of the
half-dark shelter, she caught the gleam of a pair of eyes.
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed softly. She had made out the
shadowy form of the black dwarf crouching there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; the sergeant demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;nothing, I guess.&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Her
mind flashed over their conversation there in the shelter.
&ldquo;We betrayed no secrets,&rdquo; she told herself. Then to the
sergeant she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>We&rsquo;re Going Back. And soon</i></span></h2>
<p>As they crept from the shelter the girl&rsquo;s eyes sought out
her cart and its precious load.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never touched it!&rdquo; was her joyous exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick around and they&rsquo;ll get your radar,&rdquo; was the
sergeant&rsquo;s encouraging comment. &ldquo;Some dirty spy has put
a finger on this spot. That&rsquo;s the third time they&rsquo;ve been
over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spies?&rdquo; Her eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he grinned, &ldquo;India is full of spies, particularly
this city. These Indian people are always hating someone.
Besides, there are a lot of Burmese people here, driven
from their homes when Burma was lost. One reason the
Japs won that fight was because the Burmese people let
the British down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they?&rdquo; She was interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they? Say! They erected road blockades everywhere.
Wrecked trucks, blew up the bridges,&mdash;everything.
But I&rsquo;ll bet they wish we were back now. What the dirty
Japs aren&rsquo;t doing to them these days!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going back!&rdquo; The young sergeant&rsquo;s voice
dropped to a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Sooner than you think. It&rsquo;s
in the cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Take me along!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s excited whisper told
of her eagerness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sure fix it that way if I can. You&rsquo;re a real soldier,
and you&rsquo;re on the know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Ted Mac Bride,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Mac, for
short. I&rsquo;d be mighty glad to have you in our outfit, Gale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale Janes,&rdquo; she finished for him. &ldquo;Thanks a lot, Mac.
If you&rsquo;ve got any drag with the colonel, pull a string or
two and we&rsquo;ll do the war together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I will.&rdquo; For a space of seconds his mind
was on the girl, then his eyes roved over their surroundings.
&ldquo;Not much left but the hole where that bomber blew
up.&rdquo; He nodded toward the distant palm trees. &ldquo;Want
to go see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks. I&rsquo;ll leave that to you.&rdquo; She gave a little involuntary
shudder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost time for tea over at my
club.&rdquo; She grinned broadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find my coolie and trundle
my cart away. Fine practice we had. Less said about it the
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good hunting and mum&rsquo;s the word.&rdquo; He put a finger
to his lips. Then he was away.</p>
<p>An hour later no one would ever have guessed that
Gale Janes had ever escaped from the boredom of being a
perfect lady.</p>
<p>Her &ldquo;club&rdquo; was no mere work of the imagination. It was
real enough, and quite gorgeous. In the days of peace and
plenty it had been called &ldquo;The Saddle and Gun Club.&rdquo;
Swanky Englishmen in spats and riding breeches had
lived there. There they had talked of riding and racing and
of elephant and tiger hunts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Now the saddles and guns were serving a sterner purpose.
The men had gone to war. And their club had been
turned over to the ladies of the U. S. Armed forces, WACS
and nurses, with a visiting WAVE now and then.</p>
<p>The lounge of the club was an immense place, all
screened in and open to every breeze. Here an endless
array of easy chairs invited one to rest. At one end of what
had once been a bar, sodas, orange juice, tea and cakes
were now being served.</p>
<p>After a shower Gale Janes had dressed in the blouse
and khaki slacks. At the bar she had selected cakes and
a tall one of iced tea, then had accepted the inviting comfort
of a huge rattan chair.</p>
<p>As she sipped her tea she listened to the conversation
around her. All of a sudden she became interested in the
things a little brown girl&mdash;a native nurse&mdash;was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was exciting! Oh, so exciting!&rdquo; The brown girl&rsquo;s
voice rose. &ldquo;It was funny too, like a circus. There we were,
a hundred and fifty of us,&mdash;maybe not so many and maybe
more&mdash;all retreating, and with a colonel as our guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have seen him!&rdquo; She laughed a merry
laugh. &ldquo;There he was&mdash;a great man! Oh yes! A very great
man! Dressed in a shirt and shorts&mdash;his brown legs all
covered with hair and over his shoulder a tommy gun.
Him&mdash;the biggest fighting man in Burma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, truly!&rdquo; the native girl went on. &ldquo;But he was
wonderful! Not just funny. He is an old man, but when
we waded for hours in the stream, younger men couldn&rsquo;t
take it. They just tumbled on the shore and groaned. But
the old colonel,&mdash;he marched right straight ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we girls&mdash;&rdquo; she laughed again. &ldquo;There were six
of us, all native nurses trained by a great missionary
doctor. We girls really had fun. We splashed in the water,
held our skirts high and sang silly songs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you know,&rdquo;&mdash;she was very serious&mdash;&ldquo;we were
retreating from Burma. All our Chinese armies had been
defeated. We had to get to India, the colonel and all of us,
so we could get more men. Oh, many, many more men!
And go back to save my native land, Burma, and then to
save China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Than Shwe,&rdquo;&mdash;a blonde WAC addressed the
native girl, &ldquo;Why were there so very few of you? Why not
a whole army?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Gale Janes turned her chair around to join the
circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! But no! It was impossible.&rdquo; Than Shwe
spread her small hands wide. &ldquo;It was a great distance.
There are rivers and mountains. Oh! It was very bad!
And we must go fast. Armies, they move very slow. Always
there were the Japs. If we meet the Japs by the river or
on the mountain, then we are through, finished, all gone,
and the colonel he would be gone too, and that would be
very bad, for he is a very great man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! But yes, it was funny!&rdquo; The native girl was bubbling
over again. &ldquo;It was&mdash;how do you say it? A scream. Yes,
it was a scream. We had not much to eat. We were cold
and we were sometimes very wet, but you should have
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For days we waded down that river. Then it got very
big. So we made rafts. We girls wove bamboo mats and
put them on poles to keep off the sun and the rain. And
Bill, he rode on our raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill? Who was Bill?&rdquo; someone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill? Oh, yes! He was a reporter, you know, he writes
all about the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should he ride on your raft?&rdquo; the girl with a
very long face asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Some man must go on our raft,&rdquo; the native
girl went on. &ldquo;So Bill, he goes. This raft goes this way,
then that way, then it hits rocks. Bill, he must push with
a pole. This way&mdash;that way&mdash;make the raft go straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes Bill, he gets very wet. Then he is cold. So
he puts on Etta&rsquo;s longyi. Etta, she is large. I am very small.
Oh, yes! It was a scream. Three days we are on that raft.
But I talk too much. I tell you too many things. I not talk
so much. Three days we ride on that raft. Then we are
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Gale asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; one of the girls exclaimed. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
you have a map?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;I? No. I do not need a map. The colonel, he has the
map. I go where colonel go. Always! Always!&rdquo; Than Shwe,
the native girl, threw back her small head and laughed.
&ldquo;And now we are going back. Sooner than you think, we
go. And next time we don&rsquo;t come back walking, wading,
barefoot. Oh, no! We come back in&mdash;how you say it&mdash;in
great triumph. And that day, the colonel, he is the very
great man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Than Shwe,&rdquo; another girl broke in, &ldquo;You left us on
a raft riding with that young reporter you call Bill. You
just have to finish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill? Oh yes, Bill.&rdquo; The native girl brought herself
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she sat up abruptly, &ldquo;We heard airplanes
and we said, &lsquo;It is the Japs. They will bomb us. We shall
die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it the Japs?&rdquo; a girl whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Those were British planes. They dropped packages
of food close to the river. Bill, he went off the raft
like a beaver and brought us back oh! so much food! Ah,
then we had a feast and we all were happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye and bye we came to a mountain, a very high mountain.
And by the mountain was a very little town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colonel say: &lsquo;We will go over the mountain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people of that town say, &lsquo;There is no trail over
that mountain. It is very high and very cold. You will die.
Besides, on that mountain live head-hunters. They will
eat you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the colonel tightened up his belt. He put his
tommy-gun on his shoulder and he said: &lsquo;We will go
over the mountains!&rsquo; And by God! We did!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Than Shwe,&rdquo; a WAC with a long face protested, &ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t swear. It isn&rsquo;t nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the native girl&rsquo;s eyes gleamed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the
colonel did say. What he say, I say, and where he goes, I
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time there was silence. Then with a sigh, the
native girl concluded: &ldquo;The mountain, he was not so bad.
At the top we got very cold, but we slept together all in
a heap and it was not so bad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we came to a hut,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;In that hut
there was a white man. He said, &lsquo;I came for you. I have
five hundred coolies. We came five days. Now you go
back five days. The coolies, they carry you, carry everything.
Then you are there.&rsquo; And see!&rdquo; The girl spread her
hands wide. &ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than Shwe, you forgot to swear that time.&rdquo; Gale&rsquo;s eyes
shone with a teasing light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do that for you alone, in private.&rdquo; The girl gave her
an appreciative smile. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;We come. But
we go back very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Than Shwe&rsquo;s story was told. She lapsed into silence. For
some of the girls, no doubt, it had been but the telling of
an amusing adventure. For Gale it was far more than that,
for though a girl, she was at heart a soldier. Her father,
her grandfather and all others as far back as could be
traced had been soldiers. She was a WAC, but WACS
were soldiers too, in for the duration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>She had heard sketchy accounts of the colonel&rsquo;s retreat
from Burma. Now, for the first time, in brief but vivid
form, she had heard from the lips of one who had joined
in that forlorn but glorious march, the entire story. Nothing
in all her life had stirred her so deeply, not even her
success of the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by God! We&rsquo;re going back,&rdquo; she seemed to hear
the native girl repeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she goes, I go!&rdquo; she told herself with deep-seated determination.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Radar&rsquo;s Secrets Are Not Told</i></span></h2>
<p>Than Shwe, who had become the center of an impromptu
gathering, slipped away, and the circle broke up. After
stirring her iced tea thoughtfully, Gale drank it slowly,
set the glass down, rose, stretched herself, then retired to
a secluded corner. The magazine was a blind. She did
not read&mdash;had not intended to read. She wanted to be
alone to think.</p>
<p>Life for her had moved rapidly that day. She had gone
to the field to practice with an anti-aircraft gunner. Her
sham battle had turned into a real fight. With her help
Mac had downed a Jap bomber and at this moment was being
toasted by his comrades. She had no doubt of that. She
had asked him to leave her name out of it. That he would
respect her wish she did not doubt. But there were the two
gunners. What of them?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great world,&rdquo; she whispered with a sigh. &ldquo;A man
shoots down a bomber and is covered with glory. A gal
assists in downing the bomber, does the heavy end of the
job, if you ask me, and what does she get? I ask you.
A good bawling out, if someone gives her away. For
what? For jeopardizing her life in the defense of her country
and the defense of India, China, Burma and all the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For months this whole question of woman&rsquo;s part in the
war had been in her hair. She had graduated from college
in June. Her twenty-first birthday came three days after
graduation. On her birthday she had joined the WACS.
She had planned for this a long time. In college she had
taken all the courses that would help&mdash;outdoor gym work,
Red Cross, first aid, and all the rest.</p>
<p>From college she had gone to Fort Des Moines where
many of the WACS had received their training. How she
had loved that place! Fine old brick barracks, great spreading
elms, all that went for making an army camp seem
wonderful&mdash;that was Fort Des Moines!</p>
<p>They had worked hard. Endless hours&mdash;up early, to
bed late. She hadn&rsquo;t minded for she was preparing herself
for something truly great. Was she not to be a real soldier?
To have a part in a great war? Surely this must be true.
They had taken one A out of WAAC, making it Woman&rsquo;s
Army Corps. That &ldquo;Army&rdquo; was the really big word.</p>
<p>Because she had always been interested in radio, had
built receiving and sending sets with her father&rsquo;s help, she
had taken up the radio branch of the service.</p>
<p>When her primary training was over at Fort Des Moines
she had gone to a special school for further radio training.
There she had learned to operate and repair all manner of
army sets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>She had entertained fond dreams of soaring away in a
flying fortress as its radio engineer.</p>
<p>And then the magic of radar had come breaking into
her little world. Radar had charmed and intrigued her. She
was allowed to remain for a special course in radar.</p>
<p>She had gotten this far in her bittersweet meditations
there on the shady porch at the &ldquo;Club&rdquo; in India when a
slight stir at her right caught her attention. Someone had
taken a chair close to hers. On looking up she was surprised
to see that it was the native girl nurse, Than Shwe.
She favored her with her best smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; the girl hesitated. &ldquo;Just now I hear that something,
they say radar, helped bring down a Jap bomber.
This is splendid. But what is radar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale started. So there it was, so soon! Did Than Shwe
suspect that she was the one who had helped with radar?
She doubted that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radar,&rdquo; she replied quietly, &ldquo;is like radio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do not shoot with radio,&rdquo; the native girl
stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor with radar, either.&rdquo; Gale laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it then that radar does? And how does it do
this?&rdquo; The little native girl&rsquo;s voice was eager.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you much, Than Shwe.&rdquo; Gale&rsquo;s voice was
kind. She liked this native girl. Gladly would she march
at her side on the way back to Burma, and beyond. &ldquo;This
much I can tell you,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;It has been printed in
a magazine and is no military secret. With radar we send
out radio impulses, like little sparks, only you can&rsquo;t see
them. We send out thousands and thousands of them.
Most of these go on and on like lost sheep. We never hear
of them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some of these,&rdquo; Than Shwe whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Gale agreed, &ldquo;some of these run into a solid object
like a ship or an airplane. Then they bound back like a
flash to tell us that so many feet or inches away they ran
into something and got a terrible bump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Than Shwe gave a leap. &ldquo;Then you know where
the enemy ship or plane is! That is quite wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Than Shwe, it is wonderful. But that&rsquo;s all I can
tell you, absolutely all.&rdquo; Gale&rsquo;s tone was fearfully final.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not ask you one more question,&rdquo; said the native
girl. And she kept her promise for a long, long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than Shwe,&rdquo; said Gale. &ldquo;That colonel you were talking
about a little while ago, the one who waded the river
in shorts with a tommy gun on his shoulders and brought
you all safely out of Burma&mdash;was that our colonel, the one
we have here now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the same one.&rdquo; Than Shwe&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is going back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very soon. That is all I must say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Than Shwe,&rdquo; Gale whispered. &ldquo;Thanks a
lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Than Shwe&rsquo;s chair was empty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>As Gale resumed her meditations, it was with a disturbed
mind. Somehow the story of her afternoon&rsquo;s adventure
had gotten round. It had not yet been definitely connected
with her. Or had it? In the end it would be. And
then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well! Let them do what they think they must,&rdquo;
she whispered.</p>
<p>Once more her mind was busy with the days just past.
When her radar course at the school had been completed
she was ready for work.</p>
<p>She had been sent to Texas where she worked, not at
radar, but radio, directing traffic for an airfield. That
was interesting and, for a time, exciting. She had made
many fine friends. But this had not satisfied her. There
was a war. She had joined the army. She wanted to be a
soldier.</p>
<p>She had applied for overseas service and was accepted.
North Africa and Australia had been suggested, and then
India.</p>
<p>She had often dreamed of India with its temple bells,
its sacred monkeys and much else that was strange and
weird. More than that, she knew that India was to be the
starting place for the march across Burma and across China
to Tokio, and the end of the war. Why should she not be
in the finish? India it should be. And India it was.</p>
<p>Once again Gale became conscious of the arrival of an
occupant for the chair at her side. It was the WAC with
the long face. (Cora Shaw was her name.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Cora was slim, precise, devoted to her conventions and
to the young captain whom she served as yeoman (private
secretary). Her captain was charged with the task of securing
billets for American troops arriving in the city. No
matter how many went with the colonel, &ldquo;very soon&rdquo;
others would be coming&mdash;two transports had arrived that
very day. For this reason Cora&rsquo;s captain would remain in
the city, and so too would Cora, which was, Gale guessed,
just what Cora wanted&mdash;a good safe spot with a handsome
captain at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; Gale asked herself. &ldquo;Who could wish
for a nicer safer way to fight a war?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t quite know
the answer to that one, so she passed it up to turn an inquiring
face toward the girl with a long face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearie, I just heard the strangest thing.&rdquo; Cora could
purr like a cat. She was purring now. &ldquo;They shot down a
Jap bomber near the airport this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they?&rdquo; Gale drawled. &ldquo;How sort of thrilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. And do you know they say that somehow
radar, that new invention, helped to bring him
down,&rdquo; Cora purred on.</p>
<p>Gale was seized with a mild panic. How much did this
girl know? Whatever she knew she would tell&mdash;she was
that kind. For a space of seconds Gale said nothing. Then
she managed her slow drawl again: &ldquo;Oh yes! Radar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bomber came down close to the gun that fired the
shot.&rdquo; Cora gave Gale a searching look. &ldquo;Oh dear! I hope
none of our group was mixed up in that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mixed up in a falling bomber?&rdquo; Gale exclaimed.
&ldquo;Goodness yes! She might get hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean!&rdquo; Cora dropped her purr.
&ldquo;You know as well as I do that some of the WACS have
been trained in the use of radar. And you know also that
we are not supposed to be in places of extreme danger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no!&rdquo; Gale drawled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ladies, all of us.
And ladies don&rsquo;t go in for rough stuff. They don&rsquo;t even
swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a blow under the belt. Cora recoiled.</p>
<p>But in a moment she was purring again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearie, could you tell me a little about radar? How
does it work? How can it help bring down a bomber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Gale asked herself. &ldquo;Is she a spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Cora she said, &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t tell you a thing. Radar&rsquo;s
been written up in a magazine&mdash;Life, I think. All that is
to be known by common, everyday folks is written down
there. The librarian can find the copy for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she took up her own magazine. The interview
was ended, but she did not yet know how much Cora knew
about the affair and would not for worlds have asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sent back to America,&rdquo; she told herself. Well, at
least she had experienced one thrill, and that was a lot
more than a girl like Cora would ever know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>At that she began again, rather sadly reviewing her
past. What appeared to be the death blow to her fond hope
of having what she considered to be a real part, a part
filled with thrills and danger in a real war, had come
shortly after her landing in India. A large group of WACS
had been gathered in a USO recreation hall. There they
had been assured in a lengthy and rather severe speech
by a fellow WAC who had been a matron in a girls&rsquo; school
that under no circumstances would they be asked, or allowed,
to enter the field of actual battle. That, in fact,
India was their ultimate destination, and that they had
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; a prim little gremlin was
asking her at this moment. &ldquo;You are in India, and today
you have had a real part in a real battle of the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was her reply to the gremlin. &ldquo;The Japs were
over this place three months ago. They were over again
today. When the colonel and his grand American army
get on the march, the Japs will be too busy for a return
visit. So then we will be quite free to dream the happy
hours away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she exclaimed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about?&rdquo; came in a brisk, masculine voice.</p>
<p>Startled, Gale sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you were,&rdquo; said the voice.</p>
<p>She found herself looking not into the face of a gremlin
but at the colonel, their colonel, he of the hairy legs and
the tommy gun over his shoulder&mdash;the little native girl&rsquo;s
dream of a great man, a real colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you were,&rdquo; the colonel repeated, dropping into the
big easy chair at her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Burma or Bust</i></span></h2>
<p>Gale was surprised and startled by her visitor. She had
talked to the colonel once, and that only the day before.
He had suggested that she go out and practice with
Sergeant MacBride, and had named the hour. She had
kept the appointment. But after that? Thrills and chills
still coursed through her being at thought of those exciting
moments.</p>
<p>The colonel carried no tommy gun now, and his dress
was no longer unconventional. She found it difficult to believe
that this immaculately dressed officer, whose buttons
and insignia shone, and whose pink cheeks were the last
touch in perfection, should ever have led a group of ragged
barefooted men and girls down a river and over a mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have good practice today?&rdquo; he asked. A strange smile
played about his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Ver&mdash;very good.&rdquo; She swallowed hard. &ldquo;Very fine
practice, and&mdash;and&rdquo; the words came unbidden &ldquo;Grand
hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not start or stare&mdash;merely smiled wisely&mdash;a smile
that said plainer than words,&mdash;&ldquo;Umm! You and I have a
secret, a very fine secret.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The colonel leaned forward in his chair. &ldquo;I had been
tipped off that there would be an air raid.&rdquo; His voice was
low. He glanced over his shoulder. &ldquo;I have had a great
deal of experience with men soldiers and nurses, but none
at all with lady soldiers. I had my own ideas regarding
their reactions once they were under fire. Others,&rdquo; he
paused, &ldquo;Er&mdash;well&mdash;they had different ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You&rsquo;re forgiven!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed softly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
thank you from the bottom of my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; he asked simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For believing that I wasn&rsquo;t soft&mdash;that I could take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he beamed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I
did believe, and now I know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo; He leaned forward in his chair. &ldquo;I lived in
China a long time before the war. I speak Chinese like
a Chinaman. I was in China for three years as an observer,
watching the Japs fight the Chinese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hard man. War is my business. But China wrung
my heart. I have seen whole families, men, women and
children who had tramped five hundred miles to a place
of safety where they could start again. And always with a
merry laugh on their lips, a laugh at Fate. The Chinese
people will win the war. A people who laugh at Fate as
they have laughed, cannot lose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;That does not mean that they have not suffered,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;I have seen women and children blown to bits
by shells and bombs; seen them burned in their homes;
watched delicately bred women trudge on foot weary miles
day after day. And I have asked myself, &lsquo;Are American
women more important in the sight of God than these?&rsquo;
Like American women Chinese women bear children and
love them. They help to make a home for them. If occasion
arises, they die for them cheerfully. No woman
can do more. And these are the people we are to fight for.
China is our destination&mdash;China and then Tokio. Time is
precious. Too many already have perished. We must do all
we can, all of us, men and women alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Gale&rsquo;s voice was husky. &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s what I think.
I&mdash;I would like to start tomorrow for Burma and then
China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you would. I believe you would,&rdquo; the colonel
repeated solemnly.</p>
<p>They talked for some time about the mystery, the beauty
and the enchantment of India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The temples are unusual and quite fascinating,&rdquo; the
colonel rumbled. &ldquo;I suggest that you visit some of them,
particularly the Buddhist temples. Those Buddhist priests
are very hospitable. Everyone, the humblest and the very
great are welcome there, welcome to food, shelter and all
that they have to give.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t wait too long for that. The time is short.
We shall be going&mdash;&rdquo; The colonel brought himself up
short. &ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; his voice rumbled again, &ldquo;India
is fascinating, very enchanting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I have an appointment!&rdquo; He looked at his watch,
then leapt to his feet. &ldquo;Well, goodbye and good hunting to
you.&rdquo; He shot her a flashing gleam, then he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This surely is a crazy world,&rdquo; Gale thought to herself.
&ldquo;Here is the colonel believing in us not as women but as
soldiers, and here is Colonel Mary Noble Hatch, a
perfect lady, who had devoted her life to the task of molding
the character of young girls and who is now the head
of all the WACS in India, holding up a nice, soft, refined
finger and saying: &lsquo;Tut! Tut! Naughty! Naughty! Girls
weren&rsquo;t made to fight wars. How utterly terrible!&rsquo;&rdquo; Rising,
she marched away to her room, and there she met with a
surprise.</p>
<p>A WAC she had seen but never spoken to, was seated in
her favorite chair, and in the corner opposite was an extra
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Gale Janes?&rdquo; The girl sprang up. &ldquo;May I salute
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may do as you like about that,&rdquo; Gale replied
quietly. &ldquo;As you know, I&rsquo;m not an officer. My rank is the
same as yours, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this the girl&rsquo;s hand rose in a snappy salute.
&ldquo;For gallantry in action,&rdquo; she said soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed. &ldquo;Has it gotten around
like that? Mary Noble Hatch will send me back to America
on the first boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nearly as bad as that. Here.
This must be your chair. I&rsquo;m the latest comer, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it.&rdquo; Gale waved her back. &ldquo;I really like this one
with the mahogany seat. It&rsquo;s so hard and sort of substantial,
like&mdash;&rdquo; the words came unbidden&mdash;&ldquo;like our colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s big round eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Just like our
colonel,&rdquo; she agreed. Then she settled back in her chair.
She was a rather plump girl with a round face, eyes wide
apart, and a high forehead. Gale was sure she was going
to like her. She already had a roommate, but in this war
people lived as they must.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They crowded me in on you,&rdquo; the girl apologized.
&ldquo;Wanted my room for one of the higherups. I&mdash;&rdquo; Gale was
due for a shock&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only the colonel&rsquo;s yeoman (secretary
to you).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the colonel&rsquo;s secretary?&rdquo; Gale leaned forward
in her chair to extend a hand. &ldquo;Here! Shake! You&rsquo;re just
the person I want to know most. You shall have my easy
chair for keeps, my bed too, if you want it, and the five
pound box of chocolates I just received from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s lips parted. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say
I was the colonel&mdash;only his yeoman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that they both laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you the first time,&rdquo; Gale said at last. &ldquo;By the
way, your first name is Isabelle, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the last is Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Isabelle Jackson, you&rsquo;re an angel sent from
Heaven. There are a few little things I want from the
colonel, and the colonel&rsquo;s secretary is just the one to get
them for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; Isabelle replied modestly.
&ldquo;Just what is it you want?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;The colonel is going back to Burma?&rdquo; Gale leaned forward
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, undoubtedly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of course, I couldn&rsquo;t tell you, even if I knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;m sorry. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter just
when. The point is, when he does go, I want to go with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much I can do about that.&rdquo; Isabelle
settled back in her chair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to win the right to
go. Anyway, that&rsquo;s my guess. And I might add, you&rsquo;ve
got a pretty swell start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about all that?&rdquo; Gale demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; was the quiet reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the colonel&rsquo;s
secretary. There isn&rsquo;t much I can tell you, but I guess it
won&rsquo;t hurt if I just whisper a word or two.&rdquo; Her voice
dropped to a whisper. &ldquo;Lieutenant Hatch was in the colonel&rsquo;s
headquarters late this afternoon and raised a merry
fuss about some WAC who knows, it seems, all there is
to know about radar, and who, this very afternoon, somehow
got mixed up in the messy and dangerous business of
shooting down a poor little Jap bomber. Perhaps you know
who that WAC was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; Gale agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Isabelle beamed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not mention her
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Gale agreed. &ldquo;But the colonel&mdash;how did
he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d he stand the storm?&rdquo; Isabelle laughed happily.
&ldquo;How does he stand any storm? How did he stand defeat
in Burma? How did he stand the long tough retreat? Like
a man and a colonel, that&rsquo;s how. And I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo; the
words came slowly&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone is going to tell
him how he is to use men and women under his command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Gale, &ldquo;is swell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a miniature cyclone hit the place. That is
to say Gale&rsquo;s other roommate breezed in and with her was
Than Shwe, the little Burmese nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan, this is our new roommate,&rdquo; Gale said with a grin.
Everyone who looked at Jan McPherson, the girl to whom
Gale spoke, grinned. Jan was that kind of a person. More
often than not she was grinning, as indeed she was at that
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! One more of us!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;Golly! That&rsquo;s
swell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Isabelle Jackson, and what&rsquo;s more, she&rsquo;s the
colonel&rsquo;s secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, golly! The colonel&rsquo;s lady!&rdquo; Jan exploded.</p>
<p>Little Than Shwe was visibly impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say the colonel&rsquo;s lady. His yeoman&mdash;secretary!&rdquo;
Gale insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Jan apologized. &ldquo;I was thinking of that
poem, &lsquo;Rosey O&rsquo;Grady and the colonel&rsquo;s lady are sisters
under the skin.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably they are,&rdquo; Gale said. &ldquo;But the people who
sent us over here to help fight a war seem to think we&rsquo;re
all ladies and should be kept in a good safe place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good safe place!&rdquo; Jan scoffed. &ldquo;Who wants that! My
Dad was an army sergeant most of his life. I was born
under a truck in the rain. I&rsquo;ve been on a truck or a jeep all
my life, and I&rsquo;m going to this war if I have to take a crew
haircut, fake my identification papers and turn myself
into a buck private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be as bad as that,&rdquo;
Isabelle protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Jan drew up her hundred and fifty odd
pounds of good sturdy stuff, as she said: &ldquo;With me it&rsquo;s
Burma or bust! Where the colonel goes, I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burma or bust,&rdquo; Than Shwe repeated. &ldquo;That sounds
like the colonel himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does, at that,&rdquo; Isabelle agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we draw up a petition, asking the colonel
to take all of us along,&rdquo; Gale suggested to Isabelle. &ldquo;Do
you think that would help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; Isabelle agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it would do no
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that they settled down to the task of drawing up a
dignified and appropriate petition. When it was finished,
Isabelle typed it, and they all&mdash;even Than Shwe&mdash;signed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows but this petition may help make history?&rdquo;
Isabelle murmured impressively. And indeed, who did
know?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>A Light at the End of the Trail</i></span></h2>
<p>The petition was delivered and acknowledged, and there
the matter rested for some time. The rainy season dwindled
away more and more. Each day increased the suspense
hanging over the vast army camp. More ships arrived, with
guns, bombs, airplanes, tanks and men. Men were there
from all over,&mdash;America, Alabama, Illinois, Vermont,
Washington, Texas. Not a state but was represented.
There were some guessed hundreds of thousands of
Americans and perhaps as many British. All of which
added up to one fact&mdash;the colonel was going back to Burma.
Only one question remained for the girls&mdash;&ldquo;Are we to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then one day, having recalled the colonel&rsquo;s words
about temples, Gale invited Isabelle to go temple hunting
with her.</p>
<p>At first they wandered through the narrow streets in
silence, just the two of them, in an utterly foreign world.
As they saw the pinched faces of children and peeped into
the narrow, cramped quarters where they lived their life
away, strange questions passed through their minds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Isabelle, &ldquo;I have always thought
of this war as if it effected only our own people in America.
Now I find myself thinking of these strange people of
India. Yes, and of China, Japan and Russia. But most of
all, of these people of India&mdash;they hold my attention. They
say there are a billion people in Asia. There are only a
few of our people in America, compared to that. Life is
strange. All this disturbs me. Sometimes I almost wish I
hadn&rsquo;t asked to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed it for the world,&rdquo; Gale exclaimed,
squaring her shoulders. &ldquo;For no matter how many
worlds I live in after this, I can visit this one but once.
I want to see it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that they walked on in silence until they came
to a winding path leading up a hill. There were no homes
on the hill&mdash;only ancient trees and the solemn air of early
evening hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow the path,&rdquo; Isabelle suggested. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing I like better than following a strange path, and I&rsquo;ve
heard there&rsquo;s a temple up here somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; Gale led the way.</p>
<p>The path grew steep and rocky as they advanced, but
the rocks were worn smooth, as if ten million pairs of feet
had passed that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten million,&rdquo; Gale thought. &ldquo;India is very old. But
where could they all have been going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The forest trees that loomed above the trail grew
thicker and taller as they advanced until at last they shut
out the sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like something I read in a book called Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress,&rdquo; Isabelle said with a little shudder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
cared much for shadows since I read that book. I was
twelve then. I love the sunshine best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; Gale murmured. &ldquo;Perhaps we are
pilgrims on some great quest.&rdquo; She spoke more wisely than
she knew, but this quest was to have a strange ending.</p>
<p>Gale was one of those persons whose mind is driven to
thoughts of wild determination as she walked rapidly or
climbed some steep hill. The steeper the path became, the
deeper the shadows, the more fiercely her mind worked on
the problem that she knew lay very close at hand. Would
she, or would she not go forward with the colonel and his
men as they retraced the steps he had taken in retreat?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beard him in his den,&rdquo; she whispered fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
say to him, &lsquo;Colonel, all my people have been fighters,&mdash;five
generations that we know about. Dad was in the
World War; Grandfather in the Spanish-American War,
and my great grandfather in the Civil War. I have no
brothers so my father sent me. You just <i>must</i> let me go
with you on your march back to victory!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes for a moment and fell over a stone,
nearly cracking a kneecap. She had been seeing
Sheridan on his black charger shouting to his men, &ldquo;Turn
boys! We&rsquo;re going back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn boys! We&rsquo;re going back!&rdquo; she exclaimed as she
picked herself up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Isabelle stared. &ldquo;Why should we turn back?
Look. There&rsquo;s light at the end of the trail. I&rsquo;m dying to
see what&rsquo;s up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light at the end of the trail,&rdquo; murmured Gale. &ldquo;Oh!
Oh! Yes&mdash;by all means, let&rsquo;s go on. I&mdash;I must have been
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say you were!&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed.</p>
<p>Hurrying forward they at last burst out into a little
world all aglow with golden sunset. Just before them were
beds of flowers&mdash;such flowers as they had never before
dreamed of&mdash;flowers and tall graceful palm trees. Back of
all this was a temple. It was not large, but set as it was,
a mass of red stone in the midst of a gorgeous garden of
flowers, and contrasting so strangely with the shadows that
lay behind them, it set the two girls back on their heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabelle!&rdquo; Gale murmured softly. &ldquo;Did you ever see
anything more wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Isabelle replied in a hoarse whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do people fight wars to defend their temples?&rdquo; Gale
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; was the solemn reply.</p>
<p>Even as they stood there entranced, the light of day
began to flicker and go out. As if they had been a thousand
bright lamps, all alight, the flowers lost their brightness.
As if loathe to leave it, the sunlight lingered for a moment
on the dome of the temple. Then, all of a sudden, all was
in shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Isabelle whispered. &ldquo;We must see this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Together they hurried along the path of red gravel
leading to the temple door, and as they hurried, there
came the melodious ringing of many temple bells.</p>
<p>The temple door was open. At first, the large room
that in the shadows appeared vast and endless, seemed entirely
dark and deserted. A closer look showed a single
red light burning before the shadowy figure of a Buddha
that even in this faint light appeared to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; Isabelle gripped Gale&rsquo;s hand, and together
they moved forward and to the left of the door until they
came to a low bench. There they seated themselves.</p>
<p>Leaning far forward, Isabelle sat as a child sits before
the opening of some entrancing drama.</p>
<p>Gale leaned back. With the shadows, serious problems
had again entered her mind. &ldquo;I am a soldier,&rdquo; she thought
fiercely. &ldquo;Then I must fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment she seemed to see her toothless ninety-year-old
great grandfather, and to hear him tell his tales
of the Civil War. Weird and entrancing those tales had
been. There was one,&mdash;a battle fought in a great forest. He
had been wounded and lay all day behind a half-rotten
log while the enemy&rsquo;s bullets striking the log had knocked
dirt in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then at night,&rdquo; he would go on, &ldquo;A huge black man,
lookin&rsquo; like a dark angel or a devil, found me and carried
me away to a corncrib all full of good soft corn husks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;My wound hurt something awful,&rdquo; he would continue.
&ldquo;But I was dog tired. We&rsquo;d fought for three days and three
nights, so I fell asleep in that good soft bed, and never
woke up until my own captain called my name. We had
won the battle, and I had been found again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been more to the old man&rsquo;s story, much more.
He had told it over and over, but each time Gale&rsquo;s soul
was fired anew, and she would whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s wonderful! When I grow up I&rsquo;m going to
be a soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And always the old man had laughed his cackling laugh
and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you won&rsquo;t! Because then you&rsquo;ll be a lady and
ladies don&rsquo;t go to war&mdash;just only men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But women do go to war,&rdquo; she assured herself as she
sat there in the temple. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m a soldier right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On coming out of her day dream she was a little startled
to find that Isabelle was no longer at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s poking around to see what she can discover,&rdquo;
she assured herself. That, she knew, was like Isabelle.
As for herself, she had always been a little timid in
strange places of religious worship. It was so easy to commit
some prodigious blunder and to bring the wrath of
gods down upon you.</p>
<p>So she sat on in the waning light. As her eyes became
accustomed to the place, she made out the huge Buddha
and the many banners that hung from the walls.</p>
<p>As she wondered what they all meant a breeze swept
through the temple. Like avenging ghosts the banners
flapped in the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>All of a sudden she caught the sound of movement.
Then she made out the form of some person, perhaps a
monk, or a visiting pilgrim, bending before the Buddha.</p>
<p>She had scarcely made this discovery when the person,
who was garbed in a long robe, arose, turned about, then
began making his way toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a monk,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll pass close to me and
I&rsquo;ll ask him about the temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if he had read her thoughts and wished to avoid her,
the man turned at an angle, walked a few paces, then followed
the opposite wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; she thought. Her friends had visited
such temples. They had found these monks most eager to
talk, and more eager still to receive an offering.</p>
<p>There was something strange, almost fanatic about the
man. He was of ordinary height, but quite thin, and he
walked rather clumsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if he were a little lame in both feet,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>In a moment he was gone, and the place, it seemed to
her, save for herself, was deserted.</p>
<p>All of a sudden she started and stood up. The faint light
of fading day had blinked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door!&rdquo; she thought, in mild panic. &ldquo;It has been
closed!&rdquo; At the same time she became conscious of a
disturbing odor. &ldquo;Incense,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Then she discovered that by some strange magic two
great bronze apes, one on either side of the Buddha, had
been set all aglow, and that from their nostrils thin
columns of smoke rose straight toward the ceiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dark!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;We must be getting back. I
wish Isabelle would come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in a leisurely manner she moved toward the
door. Arrived there, she put out a hand for the knob. Then
she started back. There was no knob, no nothing&mdash;a very
heavy teakwood door, perfectly blank. That was all. And
the smoke of incense in the room grew thicker with every
passing moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabelle!&rdquo; she called. No answer. &ldquo;Isabelle!&rdquo; Her voice
rose. Still no answer.</p>
<p>Determined to remain calm, she walked slowly around
the room searching for the door or some other opening.
There was no door, only high, flat walls. And all the time
the Buddha smiled and the bronze apes half hidden by
smoke appeared to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Temple Bells and Terror</i></span></h2>
<p>In the meantime Isabelle found herself in a situation that
in some ways seemed more precarious than that of her
companion. Having found her way from the temple room
through a narrow door, she had wandered all undisturbed
down a hallway past several open doors. In one room she
saw long tables with benches ranged on either side. Here,
she concluded, pilgrims from distant parts were fed when
they visited the shrine of Buddha. In another room their
food was prepared, and in still another, on hard beds, they
slept.</p>
<p>Realizing that it was growing late, she tiptoed back
down the hall into the main temple room. She was about
to join her companion, when all of a sudden she caught a
gleam of light from a small room at the right.</p>
<p>As she looked within, she saw that a weird blue light
shone upon a Buddha who sat bent over as if in silent
meditation. The workmanship on this Buddha seemed
quite wonderful. The face and hands were exquisitely
carved.</p>
<p>She took three steps inside the room, studied the bowed
figure for a moment, then prepared to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Turning half about, she uttered a low cry. The door
had vanished. She faced a blank wall. This room, she discovered
for the first time, was made of eight panels, each
forming the side of a hexagon. Which panel was the door?
She had no way of knowing, and if she knew, it would
not help, for there was neither latch nor knob.</p>
<p>Here there was no stifling incense, only a pale, eerie
light. But there was something more terrible&mdash;ABSOLUTE
SILENCE!</p>
<p>Standing there breathing quite naturally she could
hear each breath. She fancied she heard her quickening
heart-beats. She had supposed that she had known absolute
silence before. She now knew that she never had.
The silence of the sea is broken by the rush of waters, the
whisper of the wind. The silence of a vast forest is broken
by the flutter of birds&rsquo; wings, the low notes of a bird&rsquo;s
song. Even in a vault there comes the low roar of street
traffic far away. Here was neither murmur, whisper, song,
nor low roar. Nothing. Absolute silence.</p>
<p>She examined the blue burning candle. It would last
perhaps an hour. Then absolute night would join absolute
silence. She pounded on the wall. The room roared. But
when she had finished pounding, absolute silence returned,&mdash;that&mdash;and
nothing more.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Unlike Isabelle, Gale knew the location of the door
through which she had entered the main temple hall, but
try as she might, she could not budge it. It was as if it
were made of iron. And indeed iron has little resisting
power that six inches of solid teakwood does not possess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>After exhausting herself in a mad effort to escape, she
resolved to conserve her energies for her battle with the
fumes that rose from the nostrils of the two guardian apes.</p>
<p>That there would be a struggle she did not doubt, for
already the fumes were making her drowsy. Lying flat
down on the floor with her face next to the door she tried
to secure at least a little fresh air through the crack beneath
the door. In this she partially succeeded. How long
she could retain her senses she could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an end for a soldier and the daughter of a
soldier!&rdquo; she thought, as a fit of wild desperation seized
her. She wanted to get up and fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight what?&rdquo; she asked herself. Then suddenly she
knew&mdash;fight those incense burners! Fight those leering
apes!</p>
<p>At once she was on her knees. Bending low that she
might avoid the fumes as much as possible, she crept toward
the Buddha and the apes.</p>
<p>As she came close to her goal the odor was all but overpowering.
She wanted to sleep. &ldquo;Sleep!&rdquo; She clenched
her fists tight. &ldquo;I must not sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last her hands were on one of the black metal apes.
She grasped its legs and pulled herself to a sitting position.
The ape was solidly fastened to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a way to put incense into this burner,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find it, open up the burner and scatter
the fire on the stone floor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>She felt the thing over, inch by inch, burning her
fingers where the incense had heated the metal, but not a
suggestion did she get regarding the manner in which the
strange incense burner was opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can do nothing.&rdquo; She sank down upon the floor.</p>
<p>For a full minute she lay there as if asleep. Then, as
strength and courage returned, she dragged herself to the
door and made one last attempt to drink in air from the
crack beneath the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t die like a poisoned rat,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I am
a soldier. I can&rsquo;t die this way.&rdquo; Only half conscious of
what she was doing, she screamed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! No!&rdquo; at the top of her voice.</p>
<p>Shocked into sudden full consciousness, she listened.
Did she hear footsteps? Encouraged, she screamed again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door swung open and she rolled out on the floor.</p>
<p>Stunned by the sudden turn events had taken, she lay
where she was for a full moment. After a struggle to bring
back her drugged senses, she sat up to find herself staring
at one of the strangest looking men she had ever seen. For
a space of seconds she believed that she had not regained
her full consciousness at all, but was in some strange
dream world.</p>
<p>Then the man spoke, and she knew he was real. He
was short and very fat. His hands and feet were very
small. His finger nails were long and curved like the
talons of an eagle. Dressed as he was in bright robes, he
seemed like some huge bright-hued tropical bird.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who closed this door?&rdquo; he demanded in a high-pitched
voice. &ldquo;Who is burning my incense? It is terrible, wasting
a whole month&rsquo;s supply in a single hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, he sprang to the leering
apes, and tearing them apart by some trick known only to
himself, spread powder and glowing sparks over the floor.</p>
<p>After that he danced away on his tiny feet to throw
open a back door, and by some strange device to open a
row of shutters beneath the eaves.</p>
<p>Dancing toward the girl he demanded again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did this? I was away but a moment. You or some
other one did this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Gale agreed. She was standing now, and towered
above him. &ldquo;Someone did it, but not I. There was a man
here when we came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Then there are others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only my companion,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, we
are soldiers&mdash;American soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are a woman!&rdquo; He stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soldiers in uniform, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;In China too the women fight.
We shall win the war. When women fight they never
lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said there was a man.&rdquo; His voice changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes&mdash;I&mdash;I remember!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;He was a slim
man who walked a little lame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In both feet,&rdquo; Gale suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, in both feet. He said he was a pilgrim. Everyone
is welcome here. Come.&rdquo; He took a step. &ldquo;It is time to
eat. You and your companion are welcome. You shall eat.
If you desire, you shall spend the night here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! no!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I am not hungry. My
companion has vanished. We must find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come.&rdquo; He grasped her hand. She squirmed a little.
The hand with those talons was terrible, but she did not
let go. She dared not. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he invited once more.</p>
<p>He led her through the door at the back of the large
room and into the dark hallway beyond. Here he lit a
large candle. Once again gripping her hand, he led her
into room after room, murmuring again and again, &ldquo;Not
here. Not here. It is very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he paused. &ldquo;There is but one other room,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;That is the Room of Perpetual Silence.
There the brethren go for meditation. If the door is closed,
we dare not open it. Never is the door opened by another
when a brother is in meditation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! But we must open the door,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come. We will look.&rdquo; He fairly dragged her along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door is closed. We dare not open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of room is it?&rdquo; Gale stalled for time to
think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walls are very, very thick.&rdquo; He spoke in a low
chanting tone. &ldquo;The door too, is thick. There is a Buddha,
a meditating Buddha. The floor is thick. The ceiling is
thick. No sound comes there. It is the Room of Absolute
Silence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I know what you must do,&rdquo; said Gale, filled
with sudden resolution as she thought what it must mean
to be in such a room for a single hour. &ldquo;You must open
that door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has never been done.&rdquo; He stamped a small foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will open that door or I will bring a whole company
of soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be welcome,&rdquo; he declared, squeezing her
hand. &ldquo;They shall be fed. They shall sleep here. Everyone
is welcome here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they come to tear that door down?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tear that door down?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is impossible.&rdquo; Her words carried conviction.
&ldquo;Our engineers could take this whole temple down and
carry it to China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at her in astonishment. Twice he appeared
about to speak. At last he said very simply,&mdash;&ldquo;In that case
we shall open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was just what he did. And there stood Isabelle,
blinking at the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone shut the door,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Such a
terrible place! I must have been here a long time. I
thought you&rsquo;d never come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I thought,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s sober reply.</p>
<p>At that the fat little man must have thought of the
soldiers who could &ldquo;Tear down this temple and carry it to
China.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he exclaimed, dancing about like an excited
falcon. &ldquo;I will guide you down the mountain. Wait I will
light a torch. Then we will go.&rdquo; He was away like a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange place!&rdquo; Isabelle whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could stay all night. He said that.&rdquo; Gale smiled
mischievously. &ldquo;These monks are really very hospitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! Never!&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed.</p>
<p>When each had told the other her experiences, they
were well agreed that their club was a glorious place to be.</p>
<p>And then the gnomelike monk was at their side again.
Holding a flaming pine knot torch high, he urged them
to follow him.</p>
<p>They truly needed no urging. And so, with the little
man hopping on ahead and the flaming torch making
black giants of all the great trees, they found their way
down the mountainside.</p>
<p>When they reached the first house at the foot of the
hill, as if afraid of being seen, the little monk cast his
torch on the ground, dashed out the flames&mdash;then
vanished into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a weird experience,&rdquo; Isabelle murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow I shall visit your colonel,&rdquo; Gale declared.
&ldquo;I shall say, &lsquo;Colonel, I no longer feel safe in India.
Please take me with you into Burma where there is a nice
quiet war going on.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for Gale, exciting events of quite a different nature,
events that would help to shape her future career had
been ordered by the gods for the morrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Night Bombers</i></span></h2>
<p>Gale did visit the colonel next day, but at his request,
not hers. And not a word did she say about the temple
adventure. She was rather ashamed of the whole affair.
True enough, that had been her night off. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s no
excuse for risking one&rsquo;s life in a foolish adventure,&rdquo; she
told herself savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you and Mac getting on with your practice?&rdquo;
the Colonel asked, once she was seated before his teakwood
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fine!&rdquo; she enthused. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working nights.
Shot down at least a dozen bombers only night before
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a record.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;Strange we
haven&rsquo;t had a report on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;the enemies were only
transparent plastic balls that light up and come floating
down through the night sky when I locate them with
radar and Mac shoots them down. But if they had been
enemy bombers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have scored a hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! More than one. Radar is wonderful!&rdquo; Her
eyes shone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he leaned back
in his chair, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s comparatively new to the army. And I
might add, that I haven&rsquo;t another pair like you and Mac.
Your record tops them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;oh&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is. You deserve some sort of a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reward?&rdquo; Her face flushed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a reward.
All I ask is a chance to serve my country as my father, my
grandfather and all the others have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo; He smiled his approval. &ldquo;For all
that, there may be some request that you would like to
make.&rdquo; A strange smile made bird-tracks about his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;er&mdash;at least&mdash;none that you would have a right to
grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; He sat straight up. &ldquo;In that case let
us say that your unexpressed wish may have already been
granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated. &ldquo;Oh, all right, we&rsquo;ll
say that. I&rsquo;ll be watching and waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she left the large cool room that housed the colonel
and his staff, Gale found her head in a whirl. What had
the colonel meant? Did he know all that was in her mind,
or did he know nothing? Only time would tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work harder than ever,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;No more
temple bells for me.&rdquo; In this she was partly right and
partly wrong. In the end, temples were to play a very
large part in her young life, and that very night, had she
but known it, she was to meet someone who would join
her in a rather wild temple adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>She and Mac met an hour after darkness had fallen,
to resume their practice.</p>
<p>They had been at it for a long time and were in the
process of making their most perfect score when the
phone on the palm tree jangled.</p>
<p>Gale&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat as her keen ears picked up
the words spoken to Mac over the phone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warning! Enemy bombers, in large formation, approaching
from the northeast. Be at your station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll get them!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as Mac returned
to his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t get us first,&rdquo; Mac grumbled. &ldquo;This night
fighting isn&rsquo;t so hot. I&rsquo;ve only been in it twice, but one of
those times they nearly got me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get them this time,&rdquo; the girl insisted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to do it! Think of all those women and children packed
away behind those crumbling walls beside those narrow
streets in the city only a ten-minute flight from here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s murder to attack a city like that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll fly over us to get to the city, won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure will, if they don&rsquo;t stop long enough to tear us
apart.&rdquo; Mac glanced at the dugout. &ldquo;One thing I want
understood. When I say &lsquo;Duck!&rsquo; you duck. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot
more of this night fighting than you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply, but lifting a hand to her ear exclaimed
softly, &ldquo;Listen! There they come!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; A confused roar beat upon their eardrums.
&ldquo;Must be a big flight of them tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale looked to her instruments. They were in perfect
condition&mdash;always were&mdash;but now they must be perfection
personified. A slip might mean the loss of a thousand
lives in that crowded city.</p>
<p>This done, there was nothing left but to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long now,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; Mac echoed, fingering his gun.</p>
<p>Gale wondered if she could ever describe the feelings
that coursed through her being as she waited. First a feeling
of great exultation swept over her. She had power&mdash;such
power as she had never known before&mdash;the power to
destroy a hated enemy. A dozen, a score, perhaps half a
hundred enemies might fall to death because of her radar.
She had power to save countless lives.</p>
<p>Then she went all cold. She might fail, or be killed
before she had done her work.</p>
<p>After that came a steady, calm resolve. She felt free as
air. Her fingers would do her bidding perfectly. She
wanted to sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come! Get set!&rdquo; Mac was teetering on his
toes. She knew that type too. They performed the most
dangerous tasks as if they were dancing to fast music. She
knew Mac. He was all right.</p>
<p>Now she was sending out those long electric fingers.
They went here, there, everywhere, but found nothing.
They could only reach for the stars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too far away yet,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
wait. We&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming in. Let me
show you.&rdquo; Seizing his gun control, she set it at a definite
angle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the line they&rsquo;re taking. Coming straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; Mac&rsquo;s lips were drawn into a thin line. &ldquo;Very
kind of them. Let me know if they leave that course.
When they get in close enough I&rsquo;ll let them have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And keep it up,&rdquo; she hissed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get three of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of them! That&rsquo;s a lot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough,&rdquo; she murmured. Then&mdash;&ldquo;Coming
straight on. Still coming. Same direction, same height.
How wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mar&mdash;marvelous.&rdquo; Mac&rsquo;s throat went dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still coming straight on. Same direction. Same height.
Seems as if I should see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re close now. Get ready. Same direction. Same&mdash;Fire!&rdquo;
Her voice rose to a scream. Her wind-blown hair
was in a mad tangle, her face lit as by a flame.</p>
<p>The big pom pom gun roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; Once more the gun spoke. &ldquo;Again! Again!
Again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something was happening up there in the sky. The exploding
shells boomed, while in between the sound of
oncoming planes became more and more confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost over us.&rdquo; Mac glanced at the air
shelter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stop yet. Once more,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>Once again the gun spoke.</p>
<p>Next instant, as if caught by a whirlwind, Gale was
seized from behind and sent through such a dizzy circle
that she had no notion where she was going until she
landed on the floor of the air raid shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go! We&rsquo;ve got&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish, for a pair of hands seized her and
shook her hard. &ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; a voice hissed. &ldquo;Want to get&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was drowned by a roar that tore the very
earth about them, and seemed to lift their air raid shelter
up to let it gently down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mac, &ldquo;was one whale of a bomb.&rdquo; Gale
looked at Mac. He was seated before her. Who was behind
her? Who had perhaps&mdash;no, most certainly had saved
her life?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have some hot tea,&rdquo; Mac said calmly, as he
reached for a small charcoal burner in a dark corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea? Oh yes, tea.&rdquo; Gale&rsquo;s head was in a whirl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>I&rsquo;ll Get Two of You</i></span></h2>
<p>Gale struggled to her feet so suddenly that she banged
her head on the low ceiling of the air raid shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to get out of here,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Just got to down one of those bombers. We&mdash;&rdquo; She
stopped short. The roar of more exploding enemy bombs
drowned the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>And then, ten times louder, though from some distance
off, came another roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got one of them, sister,&rdquo; said a voice behind her.
&ldquo;You sure got one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had the voice died away when there came a
second terrific roar. This time it was much closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; the voice exclaimed. &ldquo;Say! Night fighting,
at that! You&rsquo;re really good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted three,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s instant reply. &ldquo;Come on,
Mac, let&rsquo;s get out and down one more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something tells me you have nothing left but your
hands to fight with,&rdquo; said the voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noth&mdash;nothing left?&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you a coke that your outfit is blown to bits,&rdquo;
said the voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of bombing, some of it
close. Too close. But none as close as that. That bomb
came very near sending us all to Glory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Mac agreed. &ldquo;Uncle Sam&rsquo;ll love to fix
me up with a new gun. I don&rsquo;t mind that. A change is
always welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had everything fixed just the way I wanted it,&rdquo;
Gale all but wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it is in war, and
all of life, I guess. Perhaps that&rsquo;s what war is all about.
I wouldn&rsquo;t know. People get things fixed up just the way
they want them&mdash;a home&mdash;a good job&mdash;a fine club&mdash;a golf
course to play on&mdash;lots of friends, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;re bored to death,&rdquo; Mac put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just right, they are,&rdquo; the voice agreed. &ldquo;And
then along comes the war and they cry to Heaven, &lsquo;I had
everything fixed just the way I wanted it!&rsquo;&rdquo; Suddenly the
voice faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Mac.</p>
<p>The sky was filled with sound, the roar of planes, some
high pitched, some low, fighters and bombers. The rat-tat-tat
of machine guns and the pom-pom of anti-aircraft
made hash of it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our night fighters are up. Good show!&rdquo; exclaimed the
voice. &ldquo;Your radar wouldn&rsquo;t do any good now. You&rsquo;d get
the wrong plane. Might as well settle down and enjoy a
spot of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale was still angry at this person who, impersonating
a whirlwind, had thrown her into the dugout. She was
also curious. By this time the charcoal burner gave off a
ruddy glow, lighting up the place a bit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>She turned half about. The light fell on a sun-tanned
face that seemed in some way at the same time absurdly
youthful and very old. The eyes were dark blue and deep-set.
The lips were parted in a smile. But there were lines&mdash;deep
cut lines in that face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who are you?&rdquo; she asked, without meaning to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you&rsquo;ve asked me,&rdquo; he laughed in a dry sort
of way, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I&rsquo;m Jimmie Nightingale,
and that I was once a Flying Tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A flying Tiger!&rdquo; Her lips parted in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. That&rsquo;s a fact. But now I&rsquo;m just a member of the
Ferry Command. I ferry all sorts of planes and all kinds of
things over the mountains into China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Over Burma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell&mdash;tell me what it&rsquo;s like,&rdquo; came in an awed whisper.
&ldquo;I&mdash;perhaps I&rsquo;m going there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like nothing you ever saw before,&rdquo; was Jimmie&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;Mountains all piled up in a heap. Rushing streams,
giant teakwood forests, head-hunters, villages and temples&mdash;all
that. And then,&rdquo;&mdash;he caught his breath, &ldquo;Palm trees,
pineapple fields, rice paddies, and again sandy deserts,&mdash;such
deserts as you never dreamed of. Sands and dust that
shakes you and no water to drink. No roads worth mentioning,
and silly little brown men setting all sorts of traps
to catch you. That&rsquo;s Burma at its worst and its best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the tea, Mac?&rdquo; Jimmie&rsquo;s voice dropped.
&ldquo;My throat is dry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Water&rsquo;s just ready to boil,&rdquo; said Mac. &ldquo;Wait. I&rsquo;ve got
some ginger cookies and chocolate bars hidden away here
if the rats haven&rsquo;t taken them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular feed! That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; Jimmie enthused.</p>
<p>As for Gale, she dug a comb out from beneath her khaki
unionalls and started putting her wind-blown hair to
rights. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Gale Janes,&rdquo; she volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice name, but it doesn&rsquo;t fit. How about Hellcat?&rdquo;
Jimmie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be terrible to be of some use in
the world,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Many a gale has moved a big
ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might like to know,&rdquo; she confided, &ldquo;That when
the time comes, I&rsquo;m going to Burma with the colonel and
his army on his way back&mdash;his march of triumph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice!&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;Does the colonel know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, so don&rsquo;t breathe a word of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;ve heard that it&rsquo;s going to be hard for
any woman to get a ride on that trip. There&rsquo;s going to be
a lot of hard fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the WACS will be left behind where it&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;
Her voice was filled with scorn. &ldquo;The clan I belong to goes
places and does things. My father was sheriff once in one
of the fightingest counties of the Cumberland Mountains
in old Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that right? Tell me about it.&rdquo; Jimmie was all attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember too much of it. I was only twelve
then. We didn&rsquo;t stay long, just long enough to sort of
clean things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your Dad?&rdquo; He laughed low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just Dad, that time.&rdquo; She joined in the laugh. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;ve done things together since. And we&rsquo;d do them again
over here.&rdquo; Her voice went husky. &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s a little bit of all
right, but he&rsquo;s over age and they wouldn&rsquo;t take him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you came instead?&rdquo; Jimmie&rsquo;s voice was low,
friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about the Cumberlands,&rdquo; Jimmie begged. &ldquo;I
read books about them when I was a boy. They went like
this: &lsquo;He jerked a blue barrelled pistol from under his
arm and whang! Whang! The desperado bit the dust.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very accurate, but it will do,&rdquo; Gale laughed.
&ldquo;Tell me more about Burma and the route you take,&rdquo; she
begged. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you about the Cumberlands. Turn
about is fair play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Burma air trail,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the toughest
trail there is in all the world. No kiddin&rsquo;. The Burma air
route is the worst there ever was. There&rsquo;s one spot at the
crest of that towering ridge that we call &lsquo;Hell&rsquo;s Half Hour.&rsquo;
The rocks are like iron hands reaching up to slap you, and
the gales come up without a moment&rsquo;s warning to lift
you and whirl you into the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the boys have crashed there and have never
been heard from again.&rdquo; Jimmie&rsquo;s voice went husky. &ldquo;And
some of them wandered for weeks in the trackless wilderness
until some wild natives picked them up, fed them,
and brought them in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then there&rsquo;s the desert,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;A forced
landing there can mean anything from murder to suicide.
But mostly we make it.&rdquo; He drew a long breath. &ldquo;I always
have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let me tell you one thing, sister.&rdquo; His voice rose.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be mighty glad when you and the colonel have
blazed the land trail across Burma to China and straight
to Tokio. And there are signs.&rdquo; His voice dropped
to a whisper. &ldquo;There are signs, sister.&rdquo; His voice trailed
off.</p>
<p>At that instant there came the sound of some slight
movement at the back of the shelter. Quick as a flash Mac
threw the gleam of his electric torch into that dark corner.
Its gleam fell on the startled face of a little dark-complected
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black dwarf,&rdquo; Gale whispered. &ldquo;He was there
when we had that other air raid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Mac whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? Probably nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I don&rsquo;t like his looks. I have a good
notion to throw him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac! You couldn&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;s not safe,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of things that are not safe in this
strange world we&rsquo;re living in now,&rdquo; Mac grumbled as he
turned his attention to his brewing tea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were going to tell me about your Cumberland
Mountain experience,&rdquo; said Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s not so much to
tell? I was young then. It&rsquo;s all a bit vague in my mind.
Some things were being done down there that shouldn&rsquo;t
have been&mdash;too much moonshine and lots of trouble,
shooting at the feet of Union organizers who visited the
mines, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father cleaned all that up?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, after a while. One scene stands out in my
memory. Nothing much.&rdquo; She laughed lightly. &ldquo;Only
you remember events that are rather dramatic, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems that some of the men decided to gang
up on Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wipe him out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that. They caught up with him in a
big room of the old brick court house. I was with Dad.
And was I thrilled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Of course not! I said Dad was with me, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad didn&rsquo;t let the gang get too close to him.&rdquo; She
tensed a little. &ldquo;There were a dozen of those men, all
armed. Dad just sort of backed off a little and then crossed
his arms over his chest with one hand under each arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad said,&rdquo; Gale drew a long breath. &ldquo;I can just hear
him now. He said, &lsquo;Well, boys, you can kill me, but I&rsquo;ll
get two of you&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; Jimmie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I climbed up on a chair so I could see what would
happen next,&rdquo; she replied simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;a&rdquo; Jimmie whistled softly. &ldquo;What&mdash;you&mdash;you
were magnificent! But what did happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Just nothing at all,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Pete&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because those men knew that Dad had a big long
blue-barrelled gun in each hand, slung from a holster
under his arms, and they knew that he was faster than
they were,&mdash;a lot faster. They knew that if they started
things, two of them would die, and they didn&rsquo;t know just
which two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sayee!&rdquo; Jimmie whistled again. &ldquo;That was really something!
And your part was the best of all. Say! I&rsquo;ll join your
clan just any day. What&rsquo;s the countersign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good honest handshake.&rdquo; She put out a hand to
give his a good manly grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she added with a laugh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Well,
I&rsquo;ve got to be going down. Just come down with me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I would say?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would say, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t today. Just go up with me&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got me that time!&rdquo; Jimmie laughed. &ldquo;Got me dead
to rights. Well, maybe I&rsquo;ll take you up in my plane over
Burma sometimes, even if it is against the rules.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Three Secrets of Radar</i></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; Gale exclaimed, as if
some urgent need had suddenly pressed in upon her. &ldquo;IT&rsquo;s
all quiet now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This certainly was true, at least for the moment. There
was the sound of air battles dying away in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Mac agreed, snapping on his flashlight. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later they stood staring at a deep pit dug in
the ground by an exploding shell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They missed my gun by at least a dozen feet,&rdquo; Mac
laughed low. &ldquo;Pretty good precision bombing. Or is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been bad aim,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t
do your gun a bit of good.&rdquo; He was examining a mass of
twisted steel that had been Mac&rsquo;s gun. &ldquo;You can contribute
that to the next scrap drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing to contribute.&rdquo; Gale did not laugh.
To her the things she worked with, tools, scissors, radios,
just everything was real, almost a part of her. And her
radar set had been blown to bits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Mac, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we did to those
Jap bombers. That nearest one we brought down should
not be far away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks.&rdquo; Gale shuddered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never look at a
wrecked plane if I can avoid it. I don&rsquo;t mind helping to
shoot down. That hardly seems real&mdash;sort of a game. But
the results! I&rsquo;ll leave them to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like it,&rdquo; Mac agreed, in a friendly voice.</p>
<p>Mac and Jimmie walked away, but the girl stood there
staring at the hole in the ground as if trying to convince
herself it was really there. Then suddenly she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Good grief! I nearly forgot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she threw on her flashlight to begin circling that
black hole.</p>
<p>Like a reaper mowing a field of grain, she covered just
so much ground with each circle of her light.</p>
<p>In the midst of her fifth circle she paused to exclaim:
&ldquo;Oh! Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bending over she picked something up to thrust it deep
in her pocket.</p>
<p>She had been at this for some time with no further discoveries,
when suddenly she caught the gleam of another
light moving about the edge of the palm trees. Curious,
with a little suspicion welling up in her being, still pretending
to search, she wandered in the direction of that
other light.</p>
<p>The mysterious gleam wavered about on the ground
for a space of seconds, then blinked out. Instantly Gale
lifted her light, at the same time clicking on a device for
doubling its power. The result, considering the time and
the place, was rather startling. Within the circle of light,
blinking but apparently unmoved, stood a tall, dark complected
young woman. Her hair and eyes were very black.
She was dressed in a long silk gown of deep purple, dark
as night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Gale asked, still advancing.</p>
<p>As if to meet her challenge, the woman flashed on her
own light and allowed it to play upon the American girl&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You are one of those lady soldiers. So strange.&rdquo;
The woman spoke in low, musical tones. Her English was
perfect, but she spoke with a peculiar accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a WAC,&rdquo; said Gale. &ldquo;And I still want to know
what you are doing here. These are military grounds. Only
those in uniform are allowed to be here without military
escort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my country!&rdquo; the woman replied sharply. &ldquo;I go
where I please. There has been a bombing. Is it not so? I
find the results of these bombings of intense interest.
Why should I not observe them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is against military orders,&rdquo; Gale snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not of the Military Police. You are only one of
those women who were sent because there are not enough
men in America to fight a war.&rdquo; There was a suggestion
of scorn in the woman&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a member of the military police,&rdquo; Gale replied
in a steady voice. (Inside she was seething with anger.)
&ldquo;I can, however, report you, and shall do so unless you
leave the grounds at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I shall go. But without question, we shall
meet again.&rdquo; The woman laughed mirthlessly. &ldquo;I am
known to your colonel and many others of some importance.&rdquo;
At that the woman in purple gathered up the
edges of her long gown and proudly marched away into
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got what I wanted,&rdquo; Gale thought. &ldquo;Wonder if it&rsquo;s
what I wanted, after all?&rdquo; At that she resumed her circling
search, but without visible results. So interested was she
in her search that she started violently when a voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s you, Jimmie Nightingale!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Jimmie grinned. &ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s your radar set
you&rsquo;re looking for, you might as well forget it. All you&rsquo;ll
find won&rsquo;t help you much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It won&rsquo;t help me.&rdquo; Her voice dropped to a whisper.
He was very near her now. &ldquo;But it might help someone
else a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know about radar, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marvelous invention. The Navy has used it to
locate enemy boats thirty miles away, at night, in a thick
fog. Yes, and has sent the boats to the bottom before the
Japs knew they were anywhere near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been told that
the fellow who caught the first hint of the Jap planes approaching
Pearl Harbor was experimenting with radar.
And so, what about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lots about it,&rdquo; Gale whispered. &ldquo;Our enemies have
radar sets of a sort, but not nearly as good as ours. We have
secrets in our radar sets that they don&rsquo;t know about. You&rsquo;d
find them, the three most important ones, done up in
three gadgets,&mdash;none of them very large. See this?&rdquo; She
held up the things she had picked up only a short time before.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of them. That bomb tore it from my
radar cabinet. It&rsquo;s almost perfect still, for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you are getting at.&rdquo; Jimmie&rsquo;s eyes brightened.
&ldquo;If our enemies found those trinkets scattered
around here they&rsquo;d know the secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Please help me find the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He snapped on his light.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! Oh boy! We sure messed up those two bombers!&rdquo;
a voice exclaimed a moment later. It was Mac, just back
from his tour of inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale, old girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a medal this
time, whether you like it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do, I&rsquo;ll trade it for a new radar set,&rdquo; she replied
soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get that new radar set and a swell place to
use it,&rdquo; Mac exclaimed. &ldquo;Radar experts better than you
just don&rsquo;t happen. You two wait here a bit.&rdquo; Mac&rsquo;s voice
dropped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get in my jeep and spin around to make a
report. The phone&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry back,&rdquo; Jimmie chuckled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got an
appointment with destiny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>At that Mac hurried away and the two of them, Gale
and Jimmie, continued their search for the secrets of
radar.</p>
<p>For a full half hour, with flashlights painting circular
patterns of light on the grey earth, they continued the
search. Twice Jimmie came to her with the query:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both times the reply was: &ldquo;Nope. That&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third time was the charm. &ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really one of the secrets of radar! It&rsquo;s in perfect
condition, too! Oh! Jimmie! You&rsquo;re a jewel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so,&rdquo; he replied soberly. &ldquo;I was
afraid you&rsquo;d think I was a heel the way I dragged you into
that raid shelter a while back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all forgiven
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was husky&mdash;&ldquo;I did just the right
thing. In war, you have to be daring but must never be
reckless. Your life, Gale, is the one priceless thing you
have to give to your country. Your radar set, your car, my
plane,&mdash;all that we have and use, can be replaced. When
you and I are gone, it&rsquo;s final. So for your family&rsquo;s sake, for
Uncle Sam, and for me, save yourself for a good long
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a grand speech. I
won&rsquo;t forget it, ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one more secret of radar lying around
loose. We just must find it,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be gone for good,&rdquo; was his answer. &ldquo;But we can
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is just what they did for another quarter of an
hour, but without success. Then Mac came rattling back
in his jeep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he called when he saw their circling
lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale lost the three secrets,&rdquo; was Jimmie&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found two of them, but the third is still missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skip it,&rdquo; said Mac, when this puzzle had been taken
apart for him. &ldquo;This has been a hard day. We need sleep.
Here comes the guard. Not a soul will be allowed on the
grounds before sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a woman,&rdquo; Gale began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; Mac broke in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of them.
Some I wish I&rsquo;d never met. Come on. Hop in. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the guard&rdquo; was right, and there was no
mistaking its coming. A jeep came careening around a
cluster of palm trees.</p>
<p>In it rode four doughboys singing at the tops of their
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we won&rsquo;t go home until morning, we won&rsquo;t go
home until morning, we won&rsquo;t go home until morning,
and that is Irish too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any smart woman could tie and blindfold that bunch,&rdquo;
Gale grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Stick around and try it,&rdquo; Mac challenged.
&ldquo;Or else climb into this jeep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Gale capitulated. She and Jimmie climbed in and they
rattled away. But even as she rode through the shadows,
Gale could close her eyes and see the tall, stately figure of
that woman in purple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>My Destination Is Tokio</i></span></h2>
<p>Mac found three of his weary comrades waiting patiently
for his return to the parking space. Like Mac, they
had their billets in the city and hoped for a ride in. They
got it, too, for Jimmie volunteered to ride with Gale in
her jeep. Since a jeep is one of those vest pocket sized
imitations of a real car, whose front seat is comfortably
and delightfully crowded by two people, this was no great
sacrifice on Jimmie&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chums for a night,&rdquo; he murmured as he slipped into
his place and the jeep went gliding away. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s war for
you!&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;You are here today, and away tomorrow,
and tomorrow may be your last day on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you live that day as if it were your last, with all
the excitement and happiness you can pick into it,&rdquo; was
Gale&rsquo;s comment on war and life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happiness, yes. Loads of it!&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Excitement?
Well, I don&rsquo;t know. At least, if you still hope to stretch
that day into several more&mdash;and who doesn&rsquo;t?&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
go out and make a fool of yourself, get drunk, and all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hope not!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Not if you are a
flyer. I&rsquo;ve heard that high octane gas and alcohol don&rsquo;t
mix.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re darn tootin&rsquo;, they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen it tried, but the fellow who tried it didn&rsquo;t come back
to tell us how it worked. He saw two zeroes and thought
they were only one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; his voice dropped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got one more
day in the city,&mdash;a day and a night, and then I&rsquo;m off on a
dangerous mission&mdash;big four-motored job, loaded to the
top with bombs, little gifts for the little brown devils.
How about you and me having a night off together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This night is spent,&rdquo; she laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not tomorrow night? How about it?&rdquo; His tone
voiced his eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;I think that will be swell, if I can get the night
off&mdash;and I suppose I can,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you can! What chance is there of locating Jap
planes with one secret of radar missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance. But, O dear! I&rsquo;ll have to be out there at
break of dawn looking for the third secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t let that bother you. It may be blown to
bits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something seems to tell me it&rsquo;s not. Anyway I must
do my best to find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do find it you&rsquo;ll want to celebrate,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t find it I&rsquo;ll need consolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice, either way,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll be around to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You live in a club house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there at 8 P. X. and we&rsquo;ll make a night of it.
Nothing rough. Just the swellest dinner you ever ate, a
little dancing, and confessions. There must always be
confessions before a parting that may be forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale did not know exactly what he meant by &ldquo;confessions&rdquo;,
but let it go at that.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>She did not find the &ldquo;third secret of radar&rdquo; next day,
and that in spite of four hours of searching in the hot
sun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; she told herself at last, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m still
sure it&rsquo;s somewhere around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening Jimmie Nightingale called at the appointed
hour.</p>
<p>As he stepped into the big, cool lounge of the Club his
eyes wandered from corner to corner. He took in all the
big easy chairs where girls in slacks, shorts and robes
lounged in comfort. He saw the white-clad attendants
and the gleaming glasses at the bar, listened to the low
murmur of voices and the whir of electric fans, then exclaimed
under his breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! Oh boy! This is something!&rdquo; A strange smile
played around his lips as she joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d give all this up for a tent on some mountainside
by a dusty road,&rdquo; was his quiet comment. &ldquo;Or at the
edge of a desert? You&rsquo;d stand in the mud for an hour
with a mess kit in your hand waiting for a service of
&lsquo;gold fish&rsquo;&mdash;meaning canned salmon&mdash;or &lsquo;corned Willie&rsquo;&mdash;which
is soldier for corned beef? You&rsquo;d sleep on a canvas
cot, or on the ground, with all sorts of insects crawling
round you? You want to really be in the war? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just to be a soldier, Jimmie.&rdquo; Her voice was husky.
&ldquo;To be a real soldier like my Dad. Just to do my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; her voice rose, &ldquo;This is our night. There
may never be another. Let&rsquo;s not talk about war. Let&rsquo;s
just have us a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was their night, just that. He took her to a place she
had never so much as heard of, a gorgeous place to dine
and dance. Behind living palm trees slow fans
wafted breezes from the distant sea. From farther back,
quite out of sight, a strange Oriental band played bewitching
music. Gale could name neither the instruments nor
the tunes, but together they invited one to dance.</p>
<p>They did dance for a full hour until the aroma of
strange, appetizing food drew them to a table.</p>
<p>A waiter with gleaming black eyes set their table, then
placed the menu before them.</p>
<p>Without looking up Jimmie ordered for them both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use asking you what you&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; he stated without
apology. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve eaten when
you&rsquo;ve finished. I know that. I&rsquo;m that way myself tonight.
It&rsquo;s nice to be sort of delirious, half crazy, once or twice a
year. It sort of clears one&rsquo;s brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she smiled at him in a strange way.
&ldquo;This is our night. There may never be another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something seems to tell me we are to meet again.&rdquo;
He did not smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Over &lsquo;Hell&rsquo;s Half Hour&rsquo; perhaps,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger things than that have happened in this crazy
war of ours. But if this is our last meeting,&rdquo; he was serious
again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. In war, after quite a time, you stop
being afraid. To die is not so tough. I died once, as hard
as anyone can die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, Jimmie?&rdquo; she whispered huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Jap shot my plane from under me. There were four
of them. I got three, but the other one got me,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to bail out. In getting away I hit my head on
something and went out like a match. When I came out
of it&mdash;two hours later&mdash;my watch was still running&mdash;I was
lying on a bed of flowers beside a stream on the only flat,
treeless bit of land for miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flow&mdash;flowers for a funeral,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;but not for mine. But I ask you.
Didn&rsquo;t I die? If I&rsquo;d gotten a little harder crack it would
have split my skull and that would have been the end.
What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you&rsquo;d gone into another world?&rdquo; she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about that,&rdquo; he replied soberly.
&ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;s a future life. Here&rsquo;s hoping. That&rsquo;s all
I can say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo; She held up two fingers, crossed. &ldquo;But
Jimmie!&rdquo; she exclaimed, bringing him back to his story.
&ldquo;We left you lying on a bed of flowers with a cracked
head.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t so badly cracked,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I washed
off the blood, tied my handkerchief about my bean and
stumbled along until a native in a canoe caught up with
me. The native liked the looks of my knife, so I traded it
with him for a lift back to civilization. And, so, here we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was a happy ending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo;&mdash;she leaned forward&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be interested
in what Dad said to me when I went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I would,&rdquo; Jimmie grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Gale, you&rsquo;re going to war. You&rsquo;re not the
sort to choose the soft and easy way. Sooner or later you&rsquo;ll
find yourself in a foxhole. They say there&rsquo;s a lot of religion
in foxholes. Maybe so but I never saw much of it in France
during the first World War, and I was in lots of foxholes,&mdash;Chateau
Thierry, Belleau Woods, the Argonne&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that, Jimmie.&rdquo; Her eyes were shining. &ldquo;Then
he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never been so strong for the kind of religion
you get in big buildings with steeples and towers. It&rsquo;s
all right, I guess, but for my part I stand alone with God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I believe in God&rsquo;. He said that, Jimmie. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
not all,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I trust God, just as I have trusted my
fellow men. They&rsquo;ve treated me fairly well. I expect God
to be as good to them, or even better. When my work&rsquo;s
done here, if I discover there&rsquo;s another world after this
one, I expect God to give me a square deal and a real
interesting job over there, and that&rsquo;s all I ask.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo;&mdash;there was a glint of tears in her eyes,
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that a strange speech for a father to make when
his only daughter was going to war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty swell, I&rsquo;d say!&rdquo; Jimmie brushed his forehead.
&ldquo;Makes me think I&rsquo;d like to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will meet him, Jimmie,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, Jimmie, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we both come out of this thing alive. Here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lifting a glass, he was joined by the girl in a silent
toast to the future.</p>
<p>And then, there was the waiter with a big tray of food.
Jimmie had been mistaken. Gale did know what she was
eating, and was delighted. She could not have named one
of the dishes, but she did know that this one was a strange
new soup with a wild tang to it like the glorious breath
of a tropical wilderness; that that one was a rare combination
of fruits some of which she had never before
tasted, and that this was chicken cooked in a new and
delectable manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How did you ever discover
this place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was taken to it by a very high ranking British officer,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;Not that his rank mattered. Men are all alike
to me. I neither honor nor trust them too much until I
know them well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did it happen that he brought you here?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to tell you.&rdquo; He was plainly embarrassed. &ldquo;But
it seems I shot down quite a lot of Jap Zeroes just at a time
when they needed shooting down, so this brass hat who
turned out to be quite a fine fellow, got some of his
friends together and gave a party in my honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was bored,&rdquo; he admitted frankly. &ldquo;All I wanted to
do was to go out and shoot down more Zeroes. I wasn&rsquo;t
doing it for glory but for China. I had seen what the
Zeroes had done to defenseless little people&mdash;men, women
and children&mdash;in China, and I wanted to pay them back
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose that&rsquo;s how you feel right now.&rdquo; Gale
gave him a teasing smile. &ldquo;A little bored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie grinned back at her, then exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Not on
your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then suddenly Gale forgot all this. &ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
nodding toward a table in the corner. &ldquo;See that
woman in purple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he whispered back. &ldquo;Rather striking, isn&rsquo;t
she? An Indian woman of very high class. Perhaps
a little European blood in her veins. But what about
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the woman I saw out at the field last night. She
was searching the field just as I was until I made her go
away. Jimmie!&rdquo; she gripped his arm. &ldquo;I suspect her of
having the third secret of radar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why impossible?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is of very high rank. No others are allowed here
except a few like myself who have been introduced by
regular&mdash;ah&mdash;members, you might say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been high class spies,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; he argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may be one of the few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to prove it,&rdquo; he replied, unconvinced.
&ldquo;And that will be both difficult and dangerous. Let&rsquo;s
drop it for now. This is our night. Besides, the ice cream
here is most unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ice cream <i>was</i> unusual. However it is to be doubted
whether Gale really tasted its goodness, for all the time
her eyes were on the woman in purple. She was consciously
memorizing her features, the color of her hair
and eyes, her high forehead that might have been
European, her thin nose, her small red mouth, and her
thin chin. She memorized too the shape of her long fingers
and the rings set with two diamonds and a ruby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she whispered to herself, &ldquo;If I see you again I
shall know you, whether you are dressed in royal purple
or in rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if the woman had heard, she turned and looked right
at Gale. Did she give a sudden start? Gale thought so.
If this was true, she made a quick recovery, for turning
squarely about, the woman began talking with animation
to the man at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My destination is Tokio,&rdquo; Jimmie murmured, as if
talking to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What did you say?&rdquo; Gale exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Jimmie&rsquo;s reply was in a voice lower than her own. &ldquo;It is
agreed, a sort of unwritten law, that when Tokio is bombed
by planes flying from China, all the remaining Flying
Tigers still fit for service shall have a place in that flight.
I hope to be one of these. That is my confession to my
goddess for tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my confession,&rdquo; she replied instantly, &ldquo;Is that I
hope to be the radar man in the bomber you fly over
Tokio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Don&rsquo;t say it is impossible.&rdquo; She put two fingers
over his lips. &ldquo;It is not impossible. I am as good as any
radar man, and quite as unafraid. It is not impossible that
I should go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything you have said is true,&rdquo; he replied soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only time will tell. If it can be arranged I shall be
proud to have you as one of my comrades at arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;Is the grandest speech anyone
ever made to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later as they said goodbye at the door of the
Club, Jimmie gave her a little something to remember. She
found herself blushing as she hurried up the stairs to her
room.</p>
<p>She did not fall asleep at once. There were too many
thoughts and emotions to be filed away in her well ordered
mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>When at last she did fall asleep she had a most horrible
dream. In the dream she and Jimmie stood before a
statue in a park. It was a simple and unusual statue at
first, but suddenly it began to grow, to stretch up and up
toward the sky. It was a purple statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady in purple,&rdquo; she seemed to whisper.</p>
<p>Just then, in the dream the tall statue began to lean
toward them. It leaned more and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie! Jimmie!&rdquo; she tried to call. &ldquo;She is falling on
us,&mdash;the lady in purple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her vain effort to call wakened her. She found herself
in a cold sweat. Did this dream have a meaning? She
could not tell. So at last she dropped off into peaceful
slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>They Who Steal Out into the Night</i></span></h2>
<p>And then it came&mdash;right out of a clear sky&mdash;the order that
was to change the entire course of Gale&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>She got a slight inkling of what was coming from the
little Burmese nurse, Than Shwe. Like some frightened
bird Than Shwe came dancing into Gale&rsquo;s room just as
she was preparing for lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a secret,&rdquo; she chanted. &ldquo;Little Than Shwe has
a secret. She would tell, if she dared, but she dare not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! A secret?&rdquo; Gale was at once torn between her
love for the little nurse and her desire to know the secret,
especially if it happened to concern her own life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Than Shwe,&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke as quietly as possible&mdash;&ldquo;Does
your secret have anything to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know for sure.&rdquo; Than Shwe spoke slowly. &ldquo;I
am quite sure it does&mdash;yes&mdash;and for Isabelle and Jan too&mdash;it
may be terribly important.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Isabelle and Jan?&rdquo; Gale caught her breath. She
recalled the request they had signed and had sent to the
colonel several days before. She did not dare hope the
request had been granted. No more did she dare press
Than Shwe for a more definite answer. The little Burmese
girl, she knew, had a heart of gold! A little teasing, and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;It would never do. A military
secret is not to be toyed with.&rdquo; So she asked no more questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tonight. I think perhaps at nine&mdash;perhaps
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this final bit of mysterious information and a
teasing smile, Than Shwe danced out of the room.</p>
<p>Gale&rsquo;s head was in a whirl. Was the big moment near
at hand? Were all her dreams to come true? She dared not
hope.</p>
<p>She ate very little lunch. She was too excited to eat.
She drank three pots of very strong coffee. Just as she
was preparing to leave Isabelle joined her. There was
a strangely sober look on her friend&rsquo;s round, rosey face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppressed excitement,&rdquo; Gale read it, and was at once
more excited than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel kept me overtime,&rdquo; Isabelle explained, staring
at the menu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toast,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;A banana. Some cookies and tea&mdash;a
large pot of black tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You too?&rdquo; Gale exclaimed. &ldquo;Than Shwe has me
all excited.&rdquo; She spoke in a casual tone. &ldquo;And now you
seem lost in a dream. Than Shwe seems to have a secret.
What about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret? Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Isabelle, absentmindedly. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Nothing more was said until Isabelle&rsquo;s lunch arrived.
Even then Isabelle appeared to be thinking out loud when
she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you imagine being cool, really cold, after a month
of this terrible heat of India?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Gale could not, and said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, try it,&rdquo; said Isabelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Go to Boston! No one has any sense today!&rdquo; Gale
exclaimed. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s the heat. I&rsquo;ll try thinking about
being cold. The shores of a northern lake deep in
the evergreen forest&mdash;wild duck&mdash;perhaps a moose&mdash;way
back in Michigan.&rdquo; She laughed as she rose and hurried
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive out to see Mac,&rdquo; Gale told herself. &ldquo;Mac is
always so sober and matter-of-fact about things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found him directing the placing of a new anti-aircraft
gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mac isn&rsquo;t going,&rdquo; she thought. Her heart seemed to
sink. She liked Mac and had counted on working with
him for a long time. They made a good team, she thought.</p>
<p>And then it occurred to her that she was on the wrong
track&mdash;that she herself was going nowhere.</p>
<p>She thought of something else. &ldquo;Mac!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t found that third secret of radar, and I think&mdash;that
is, I hope maybe I&rsquo;m going on sort of a trip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Mac straightened up suddenly. &ldquo;What? You think&mdash;&rdquo;
He stopped short, stared at her, and then in a changed
voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget the third secret of radar! You&rsquo;re as bad as the
colored soldier in the first World War who was looking
for his arm that had been blown off. When they told him
the arm couldn&rsquo;t be put back, he said, &lsquo;Yas sir. I know
dat. But thar&rsquo;s a thirty dollar wrist watch on that arm!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac laughed at his own joke. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is war. You can&rsquo;t expect to get everything back
when a block buster drops close to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Mac interrupted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get this
gun in place before&mdash;&rdquo; He caught himself, and did not
finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice crowded little world,&rdquo; the girl told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going back to the Club and sit in a corner until something
happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she didn&rsquo;t&mdash;at least, not for long.</p>
<p>Scarcely had she downed a glass of limeade, made with
real limes, when Isabelle came rushing in to seize her by
the arm and drag her up toward their room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders!&rdquo; Isabelle whispered, flapping a paper in the
air. &ldquo;Marching orders.&rdquo; At that Gale nearly collapsed on
the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; she gasped, when at last they
were in their room with the door fast closed. &ldquo;Let me see
the orders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Without a word Isabelle handed her the paper. The
order was directed to Gale alone. Isabelle had received
hers straight from the colonel himself.</p>
<p>As she read, Gale&rsquo;s eyes widened. First there were some
words of commendation for her&mdash;&ldquo;Efficient and valiant
service.&rdquo; Then came the orders. These were brief and to
the point. She was to be prepared to leave the city by car
that night for a &ldquo;protracted absence, perhaps months. You
will travel with Isabelle, Jan and Than Shwe.&rdquo; She read
on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabelle, Jan, Than Shwe!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How
grand! But tell me!&rdquo; she demanded, turning to Isabelle,
&ldquo;Is this <i>IT</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, as far as I can see, is it,&rdquo; was the solemn reply.
&ldquo;The colonel told me nothing, just gave me my marching
orders. But to himself he said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going back. At last,
by God, we&rsquo;re going back! And we&rsquo;ve got power!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power and the glory,&rdquo; Gale whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;and the glory&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t believe he ever
thinks of that,&rdquo; was Isabelle&rsquo;s solemn reply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real
soldier. All he wants is men, machines and power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little more to Gale&rsquo;s orders. She was to take
with her only such personal belongings as were necessary.
These were to be carried on their own car which Jan was
to drive. Their bedding and equipment, radar equipment
and all else would go by truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mac?&rdquo; she said to Isabelle? &ldquo;Is he going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac is going,&rdquo; was the quiet reply. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t ask
me more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>No more was asked, and indeed, there was little time
for talking. They launched themselves at once into the
task of sorting and packing,&mdash;a real job. They had been in
India four months. In that time they had collected a considerable
treasure, rare silk gowns, carved ivory gods, green
jade, and much else. All these must be stored away in
lockers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will we be back?&rdquo; Gale asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps never,&rdquo; was the solemn response.</p>
<p>And so they sifted, sorted and packed, sorted, sifted and
packed again, until at last one modest sized duffle bag
apiece held all that would go with them.</p>
<p>Darkness was falling when they had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dinner time!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed. &ldquo;How I wish
Jimmie were here to spend these last hours of the big city
with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie? Oh, yes,&mdash;that Ferry Command boy,&rdquo; Isabelle
murmured absent mindedly.</p>
<p>In the end, the four of them, Gale, Isabelle, Jan and
Than Shwe had dinner together in a neat little place
around the corner. It was run by a Chinaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re headed for China,&rdquo; said Isabelle. &ldquo;Might as
well get used to Chinese cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about cooking Japan?&rdquo; Jan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will take time,&rdquo; Isabelle laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My destination is Tokio,&rdquo; said Gale, quoting Jimmie.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t expect to eat there. Instead, I hope to spoil
Tojo&rsquo;s dinner for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;By golly! That&rsquo;s the
stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Than Shwe threw back her small head with a merry
laugh as she repeated,&mdash;&ldquo;By golly, yes! That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour after dark they stole like fugitives from the
Club. No noise, no confusion, no congratulations, no
cheering. Truth was, very few knew they were going, and
those few were faithfully silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The army is not going now,&rdquo; Isabelle confided to Gale.
&ldquo;Just a selected few of us to prepare the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A selected few,&rdquo; Gale&rsquo;s heart swelled with pride. To
Isabelle she said, with a laugh, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make roads, build
bridges, all that, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that!&rdquo; Isabelle&rsquo;s tone was impressive. &ldquo;All that
has been done. You&rsquo;ll be amazed. Oh, no! I&rsquo;ve never been
there, but I can see it all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll steal out of the city like ships going out to join
a convoy,&rdquo; she whispered as she and Gale climbed into
the rear seat of Jan&rsquo;s jeep. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a dozen cars in
our section,&mdash;the colonel, his guard, and a few others. A
convoy of trucks will leave by another road. Other cars
will strike out by themselves. In the end, when we&rsquo;re a
hundred miles on our way, we&rsquo;ll discover that there are
quite a lot of us after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fascinating!&rdquo; Gale murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>All of a sudden Gale&rsquo;s eyes caught something that
brought her up short. In the shadows she had caught sight
of a familiar figure. &ldquo;The woman in purple,&rdquo; she whispered
to herself. Oddly enough, she found herself filled with
consternation. &ldquo;Seems like an ill omen,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Like the croaking of a raven, or a black cat crossing your
path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she received a second shock. The woman in
purple was joined by a very thin man in a long, dark robe.
He had appeared like a dark ghost. Perhaps he had been
there all the time.</p>
<p>She watched them intently while they exchanged a few
words. Then they started to move away. Gale watched and
shuddered. The tall thin man walked as if he were a little
lame in both feet.</p>
<p>At once Gale&rsquo;s mind went speeding back to those strange
startling hours in the temple. Was this the same man?
What was his relation to the woman in purple? Were they
both spies? Would she ever see them again?</p>
<p>In the midst of this questioning she felt the car start.
The mysterious pair passed from her view, and they were
on their way.</p>
<p>Did some wise little gremlin whisper, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen
the last of that pair!&rdquo;? If he did, Gale was too full of excitement
to hear him.</p>
<p>It was to be all of that in the end. The beginning of
this long, long journey was very much like driving out of
Chicago for an evening spin. Their car was different, that
was all. The road was smooth. They sped past homes where
evening lamps were alight. Here and there they swung to
one side to pass cars going in the opposite direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it seem strange,&rdquo; Isabelle murmured, &ldquo;if we
were to turn about after a bit and drive back only to find
ourselves in our own home town, in America!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it would!&rdquo; Gale&rsquo;s voice was strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like it?&rdquo; Isabelle asked.</p>
<p>There came no answer for a moment. Then in slow,
even tones, Gale said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I wouldn&rsquo;t like it a bit. This is my destiny. I&rsquo;m
in it to the finish, and wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for worlds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tokio,&rdquo; she whispered softly, &ldquo;is my destination.&rdquo; And
she really meant it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>The Unseen Highway</i></span></h2>
<p>They drove for what seemed to Gale endless hours.
Smooth, paved roads gave way to hard surfaced ones with
many bumps, but still they roared on. In their open car,
with the air constantly beating on their faces, they became
very sleepy, but Gale was determined to stay awake. This,
she knew, was to be one of the memorable nights of her
life. They were going forth to battle, even ahead of the big
push, the army. Yes, this was a big night.</p>
<p>Gale thought of the words spoken by her father just
before they started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice had been almost somber&mdash;&ldquo;In the
army you&rsquo;ll be what you young people call &lsquo;pushed
around&rsquo;. You won&rsquo;t like it. For years&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For years you&rsquo;ve been trying to push me around!&rdquo; she
had put in with a sly smile. &ldquo;And you think you didn&rsquo;t
succeed. Dear old Dad, you succeeded better than you
knew. Anyway, you&rsquo;re proud of me now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! Of course!&rdquo; He had coughed violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you is that in the army
you&rsquo;ll really be pushed around, and you&rsquo;ll not like it. But
you&rsquo;ll have to take it. You&rsquo;re in for the duration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she had asked soberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be put in a place and told to wait, when you
want action. You&rsquo;ll want to do things worse than you&rsquo;ve
ever wanted to do anything before, and you&rsquo;ll be told you
can&rsquo;t do them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know! I was there!&rdquo; His voice had risen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no one&rsquo;s
fault. It&rsquo;s war, that&rsquo;s all. And because it&rsquo;s war you&rsquo;ll have to
take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, if it&rsquo;s war I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; had been her response.</p>
<p>She smiled a little as she recalled those words now.
Only a few weeks before she had found herself up against
what seemed a stone wall. She had been told that no
WACS would be allowed to go with the army into Burma
and China. No indeed! But here she was going in ahead
of the army! She had very little notion how it had come
about, nor how long her luck would last. One thing she
did know&mdash;she was not being pushed around&mdash;not yet.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the car lights dimmed, then the car
slowed down a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jan?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. Dim out. That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; was Jan&rsquo;s quick response.
&ldquo;Colonel&rsquo;s orders. We&rsquo;re getting into a zone where
there&rsquo;s not supposed to be a road,&mdash;only a trail. The honorable
enemy mustn&rsquo;t be allowed to know about this road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little further on the whole procession halted, then
moved on, halting every thirty seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard,&rdquo; Jan explained. As it came her turn Jan gave
the countersign, submitted to a brief inspection, then
drove on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>A chill ran up Gale&rsquo;s spine. Already they were in
dangerous territory, where roads were new.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Can you drive in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; Jan asked. &ldquo;Golly, you must have slept through
your weeks at Fort Des Moines if you never saw us girls
driving those big trucks in convoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I saw them!&rdquo; Gale recalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better believe they trained us. Drive in
the dark? Say! They tied handkerchiefs over our eyes
and made us drive for hours and hours without seeing a
thing, and us in convoy, twenty trucks all going together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; Jan laughed joyously, &ldquo;I ran over a duck. But
was I to blame? The duck could see, and I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove on, a little more slowly, in all but complete
darkness. No friendly village lights now greeted their approach.
There was no moon. Here and there dark bulks
loomed,&mdash;a dog barked,&mdash;the sound of their motors changed
a little, then again they were swallowed up by the night.
These were the only signs of a village just passed.</p>
<p>More and more trees lined the roadway. At times their
towering tops shut out the stars.</p>
<p>At last there came the rattle of shifting gears. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going up,&rdquo; Gale whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the road we followed on our retreat.&rdquo; There
was a note of joyous suspense in Than Shwe&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Only
then there was no road, only a rocky trail, and we girls
were barefoot. Our shoes had been worn out on the rocks
of the river bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;No road?&rdquo; Gale exclaimed. &ldquo;No road then, and now
there is one. How come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all done by magic.&rdquo; There was awe in the little
Burmese girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know more than that. But
oh! I&rsquo;m so glad we&rsquo;re going back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed, glided forward, then climbed again.
Five times Jan shifted gears to climb. Then, after slowing
down, they came to a halt. Here too the towering trees hid
the stars, but beside the road a dim light shone.</p>
<p>A thin point of light wavered along the ground, then
pointed itself at Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Get out,&rdquo; said a familiar voice. &ldquo;Time for
midnight lunch at two in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is! What did you think? And am I tired! I&rsquo;ve
driven all the way.&rdquo; Mac&rsquo;s voice trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly! It doesn&rsquo;t seem like it could be two o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;
Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just started to drive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this they all laughed and piled out of the car.</p>
<p>If Gale had hoped for a good talk with Mac, she was
doomed to disappointment, for as she and Than Shwe
entered the long, low room that was evidently an eating
place, someone grabbed them both by the arms to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, girls? How you making it?&rdquo; It was the
colonel himself. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all sit
together at this table.&rdquo; So it happened that the four
girls ate at the colonel&rsquo;s table, along with his driver and
orderly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a Chinese place, but don&rsquo;t order chop suey,&rdquo;
the colonel warned. &ldquo;The waiter won&rsquo;t know what you
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly! Why not?&rdquo; Jan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain that later,&rdquo; said the colonel. Then he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! Oh boy! Are we in luck! This Chink&rsquo;s been raiding
a hen coop. There&rsquo;s stewed chicken and dumplings to
be had. How about an order all round? This is on me. It&rsquo;s
the happiest night of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a chorus of assents, and so the meal was
ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so happy, colonel?&rdquo; Jan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; Than Shwe exclaimed. &ldquo;This
is our road of remembrance, is it not colonel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Our road of remembrance. Than
Shwe and I are going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came down this road when it was only a path. You
were in ragged shorts and I was barefoot.&rdquo; Than Shwe
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were retreating from Burma,&rdquo; the colonel
chuckled. &ldquo;A ragged handful of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we were singing as if we had just won the war.
We were singing for the future, colonel!&rdquo; The little nurse
was as happy as her chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Than Shwe, we were singing for the future. That
time the Japs beat the tar out of us. We had a ragged army
of untrained Chinese soldiers and a few English troops, all
fine fighters, but scattered all over the map. The Japs
drove us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; the colonel&rsquo;s voice rose, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got
what it takes&mdash;tanks, guns, planes and men&mdash;thousands and
thousands of well-trained men. We&rsquo;ve got the power and
we&rsquo;re going back. Back to Burma, back to Rangoon, yes,
and back to Mandalay! With God&rsquo;s help we&rsquo;re going back
to Mandalay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the colonel&rsquo;s aide, who had a splendid baritone
voice, sang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ye back to Mandalay, where the flying fishes
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the entire group&mdash;it was a large eating place
packed with soldiers&mdash;roared out:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come ye back to Mandalay</p>
<p class="t0">Where the old flotilla lay</p>
<p class="t0">Can&rsquo;t you hear her paddle chunking</p>
<p class="t0">From Rangoon to Mandalay?</p>
<p class="t0">On the road to Mandalay</p>
<p class="t0">Where the flying fishes play</p>
<p class="t0">And the dawn comes up like thunder</p>
<p class="t0">Out of China, &rsquo;cross the bay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>They were in the midst of the song when Gale&rsquo;s eye
was caught by a bright candle held by someone in the doorway
leading to the kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>At first she thought the person was a child, for the
candle was held low. The whole place was lit by candles.
Then the person held the candle higher, and she saw his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Colonel!&rdquo; She exclaimed. &ldquo;Look quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That door! Oh! Now he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was there? Why all the excitement?&rdquo; the colonel
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the Black Dwarf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! The Black Dwarf,&rdquo; he murmured. Truth was, she
had only half his attention. He had been enjoying the
celebration to the very bottom of his soul. Now as the
song lagged, he roared out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ye back to Mandalay!&rdquo; And they sang it all over
again.</p>
<p>As for Gale, her eyes were still glued to that door. She
fully expected to see the Black Dwarf again. But he did
not reappear. He was gone, perhaps farther than she
could dream.</p>
<p>When the song ended Gale found herself in a
quandary. The colonel was having the time of his life.
Should she interrupt this to tell him of the Black Dwarf?
After all, what did she have to tell about this strange little
man? She had seen him once on the edge of the airfield,
and twice in the dugout during an air raid. And now he
was here. What was there to that? Perhaps nothing.
Perhaps a great deal. The Black Dwarf could wait, for
here came the food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>It was a glorious feast, enjoyed by all; chicken with
dumplings, baked sweet potatoes, fruit salad, and of all
things&mdash;ice cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems strange,&rdquo; she said to the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is strange?&rdquo; His eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This food. How could they do it on such short notice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had notice enough. Everything has been planned
in advance. Everything.&rdquo; He repeated. &ldquo;Wait till you see
how we have planned it! Every beam&mdash;every spike is in
its place. You will be amazed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only half understood what he was saying, but she
was impressed. &ldquo;I am to be part of something big!&rdquo; she
whispered to herself. Her bosom swelled. &ldquo;Something
really big!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; said Isabelle, &ldquo;Tell us why we shouldn&rsquo;t
order chop suey in a Chinese restaurant over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;d laugh at you,&rdquo; was the surprising reply.
&ldquo;Over here, chop suey is beggar&rsquo;s hash. When a beggar
gets good and hungry, he goes from door to door with a big
wooden bowl. At every door some scrap of food is thrown
into the bowl. When he gets home he chops it all up fine
and eats it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in America we pay fancy prices for chop suey!&rdquo;
Gale protested. &ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes back to the Gold Rush days of California,&rdquo; said
the colonel. There were a lot of Chinese workmen in one
camp. They had their own restaurant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;One night a bunch of white miners thought they&rsquo;d try
Chinese food, so they went in demanding to be served. It
was late. Only scraps were left, so the frightened Chink
threw the scraps into a big bowl, chopped them up and
served them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a swell dish!&rsquo; one of the miners exclaimed.
&lsquo;What do you call it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Chop Suey,&rsquo; was the Chink&rsquo;s reply. &lsquo;Beggar&rsquo;s hash&rsquo;,
to him. And that,&rdquo; laughed the colonel, &ldquo;started beggar&rsquo;s
hash joints all over America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the party rose to leave, Gale hurried to one of
the waiters to whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a man here who is a&mdash;a&mdash;sort of dwarf, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did have.&rdquo; The man scowled. &ldquo;He used to work
here. That was some time past. Tonight he came back and
said he wanted to work. We took him in. Now when we
need him most he has skipped out! Gone! Bah! He&rsquo;s no
good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale was tempted to repeat his words&mdash;&ldquo;Bah! He is no
good!&rdquo; She did not, but in the future the words were to
come back to her and she was to repeat them more than
ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>A Dangerous Hideout</i></span></h2>
<p>The meal over, they were once more on their way. The
road grew rougher and steeper. Jan was forever switching
from two-wheel to four-wheel driving. At one time they
seemed about to slide back down hill, but the plucky
driver held the jeep to its course and the jeep did its bit
by turning in a perfect performance.</p>
<p>The first faint touch of a false dawn was showing in
the east when the road levelled off. For another mile they
drove in what to Gale seemed complete darkness. Then
they came to a halt.</p>
<p>A moment later a flashlight appeared by the door. They
recognized the colonel&rsquo;s voice as he said, flashing his light
way to the right:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your tent is over there.&rdquo; The light shone for ten
seconds on a small, square tent. For the first time Gale
discovered that they were surrounded and probably overshadowed
by immense hardwood tropical trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so completely dark,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive your jeep close to the tent,&rdquo; said the colonel.
&ldquo;Then come back here. Someone will take you to the mess
tent for a cup of coffee before you turn in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;We sleep daytimes and travel nights,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;However,
in this case we are at the end of our journey. But
not for long&mdash;not for long,&rdquo; he repeated softly. There was a
meaning in these last few words that dug deep into Gale&rsquo;s
soul.</p>
<p>A few moments later they were all set for their cup of
coffee. Mess kits and cups were passed out to them. They
stood in line with the soldiers and received their portions
of oatmeal, toast, bacon and coffee.</p>
<p>Seated at a plain board table, they found themselves
opposite a group of doughboys who stared at them, but
said never a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like to see us here,&rdquo; Gale thought to herself.
&ldquo;Or do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meal over, they returned to the tent. Buckets of
hot water stood outside the tent door. With little cries
of appreciation, they fairly dove into these to scrub the
grime of the road from their faces and the blear from their
eyes.</p>
<p>The sun was just sending long, searching beams of
light down between the trees that appeared to reach to
the sky when at last they tumbled into their bunks, buried
their faces in pillows, and prepared to sleep.</p>
<p>Gale did not go to sleep at once. The movement of dim
lights and darting shadows were in her eyes; the clash of
changing gears rattled through her subconscious mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;in the heart of a wilderness,
on my way to war. Perhaps I have already arrived. This
may be the fringe of an army camp. The whole army may
arrive tomorrow night. At dawn there may be a battle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>That her imagination was taking her for a ride she
realized well enough, but as she lay there in the midst of
that vast silent forest, sounds began to reach her ears,
sounds both familiar and startling.</p>
<p>Indistinct at first, these sounds took on form and color.
They came from somewhere away to the right. They appeared
to come from ground level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airplanes,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>What were these? American planes, or enemy fighters
and bombers searching out their hiding place?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them search,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never find
us here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a feeling took possession of her. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be at
work searching them out!&rdquo; She half rose from her cot, then
settled back. &ldquo;What nonsense! I have neither equipment
nor a gunner. And in this dense forest it would be impossible
to distinguish them from the treetops.&rdquo; At that
she fell asleep.</p>
<p>Even in her dreams those distant roaring motors haunted
her, for in those dreams flying in the smallest kind of a
plane, she darted between great trees like pillars of a Greek
temple with the greatest of ease. Spying a spot of sunlight,
like a great silver butterfly, she slipped out into the
glorious sunshine above the sea of green that was the
forest from above. Pursued by a huge enemy plane that
spouted fire, she slipped back through the hole to re-enter
the shadows, only in the end to crash a wing against a giant
tree and to go spinning down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>In the agony of fright she tried to cry out, and so
wakened herself to the reality of cot, tent, and forest
shadows.</p>
<p>That the planes were real enough she was to learn
later. Still more surprising was the fact that her friend
Jimmie Nightingale flew one of the planes. In discovering
this she was to let herself in on one of the great secrets
of this dark forest. But for the time she drifted off into
dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>They slept until midday. After that they slicked up,
soldier style, and marched out with their mess kits. When
four American and three Chinese nurses came from tents
adjoining their own to join them at mess, they realized
that they were not alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be working with us,&rdquo; a gray haired nurse said
to Than Shwe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Then I shall be happy!&rdquo; the little Burmese girl
exclaimed. &ldquo;To be near the front to care for wounded
soldiers, that is for me a little bit of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a nice way to say it,&rdquo; was the quick reply.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way I feel about it. We shall be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is there a hospital here in the forest?&rdquo; Isabelle
asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! Not a large one, but well equipped. After our
meal I am to show it to you.&rdquo; After that they marched in
silence beneath the great trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a big church,&rdquo; Jan whispered. &ldquo;The kind they
have in England.&rdquo; And so it was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why! This is quite a hospital!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed as an
hour later the head nurse led them into a long, low building
of permanent wood construction. &ldquo;I thought it would
be only a tent,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad location for a base-hospital,&rdquo; was the quiet
reply. &ldquo;Only one wing is occupied now. But tomorrow?
Who knows?&rdquo; The motherly woman sighed. &ldquo;This is war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One fact amazed Gale. In one corner were sixteen
wounded aviators. Six were Chinese, the others Americans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard about air battles in this sector.&rdquo; She
showed her surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In war there are many surprises,&rdquo; said the nurse. &ldquo;This
is only the beginning for you. Each day your horizon
will be broadened, but only at the commanding officer&rsquo;s
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale talked to some of the young American flyers. They
spoke with pleasure of America, and asked many questions.
Not one word did they say of their exploits. To a
man their chief desire was to get well and to get back into
the conflict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I want to get back to work!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed as
she left the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something tells me you will be back at work sooner
than you think,&rdquo; said the nurse. She was not wrong.</p>
<p>That evening Gale received a message from the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will call for you an hour before dawn,&rdquo; was all it said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Needless to say she was dressed and ready when Jan,
with the Colonel in the back seat of her jeep, came chugging
in through the dark forest.</p>
<p>With their destination still a mystery, the colonel, who
had handed Gale up to a place beside him, directed Jan
in and out among the trees until a winding road that
climbed steeply came under their wheels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow this road until you come to a small cabin,&rdquo;
was the colonel&rsquo;s instruction. After that he began talking
in low serious tones to Gale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am taking you to your place of labor,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much like the one you just left. It&rsquo;s much wilder
and more dangerous. But you asked for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I asked for it, and I&mdash;I think I can
take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father was a soldier, and a good one. I know him
well,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Do you?&rdquo; A warm glow of appreciation and deepening
friendship flooded Gale&rsquo;s being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your new station,&rdquo; the colonel went on, &ldquo;save for
Jan and two Chinese guards, you will be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not be there. Your post will be an exposed
spot, but you shall be well hidden. We couldn&rsquo;t risk anti-aircraft
fire from that position. It would give us away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale felt a chill run up her spine. &ldquo;Jan,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;two Chinese guards,&mdash;practically alone, no protecting
guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came to a stop at the edge of the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;From this spot you will always go on foot, and always
before dawn, or after dark.&rdquo; The colonel produced a small
flashlight. They walked round the cliff, then began to
climb. Their path was a stairway cut into the solid rock.</p>
<p>When Gale and Jan were completely out of breath,
they made a turn to find themselves facing what appeared
to be one more rocky wall, which it was, save for a low, narrow
door.</p>
<p>Once they had passed through that door and closed it,
the colonel snapped on a light, and they found themselves
in a room some twelve feet square. The wall, even the
ceiling of this room were of rock. A small window had
been cut opposite the door. This, at that moment, was
closed by a heavy shutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, for the present,&rdquo; said the colonel&mdash;his tone was
impressive&mdash;&ldquo;will be your post. It is not entirely safe.
It is extremely important. I may tell you quite frankly,&rdquo;&mdash;his
voice rumbled low&mdash;&ldquo;that if there was a man under
my command who could do a better job up here than you,
he would be stationed here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than&mdash;Oh, thanks!&rdquo; Gale stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me.&rdquo; His manner was almost blunt. &ldquo;This
is war. In war, the best man for each post must fill it. You
are the one for this station. You have been tried by fire,
and have not been found wanting. Japs beat the tar out
of us in Burma. Now we&rsquo;re going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And beat the tar out of them,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice
dropped&mdash;&ldquo;I suggest that we have a cup of coffee. In half
an hour I shall give you a glimpse of our promised land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burma?&rdquo; Gale whispered in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None other,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What magic!&rdquo; she murmured. To this he made no
reply. But producing a large thermos bottle, the colonel
took a loaf of bread, an electric toaster, and half a dozen
doughnuts from a niche in the stone wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the comforts of home,&rdquo; he murmured as the two
girls assisted in preparing breakfast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Pete</i></span></h2>
<p>Eager as Gale was for a look at the scene that lay spread
out beneath her window, she gladly followed the colonel&rsquo;s
lead in a slow, leisurely breakfast. Full well she realized
that this was one of the rare moments of her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the lull before a storm,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Soon
an army will come sweeping up from below. Then we
at this bleak outpost will be all but forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she looked at the colonel sitting there drinking
coffee and munching toast, she found it difficult to realize
that he was a truly great man. &ldquo;So simple! So kind and
thoughtful of others,&rdquo; ran through her mind. She
wondered in a vague sort of way if all the truly great ones
of this earth were not at some time simple and kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dawn must be here!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed at last.
Putting down his empty cup he walked to the window and
raised the shutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That is Burma&mdash;the land we
left behind. Now we&rsquo;re going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;Is that Burma out there?&rdquo;
They were looking down first on a green ocean of treetops,
then upon low rows of low mountains, and after that, dim
in the distance, green valleys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;The distant hills and valleys are in Burma,&rdquo; the colonel
explained. &ldquo;If you look closely you will discover a touch
of blue here and there. Those are little patches of blue
in the river down which we waded for so many hours on
our retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish Than Shwe were here!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This would be a rare treat for her,&rdquo; the colonel agreed.
&ldquo;Unfortunately, some wounded airmen were brought in
this morning. Our little nurse will be busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale looked at him hard, but said never a word. She
wanted to know about these air battles,&mdash;wanted to be sure
she would play her part in a real war.</p>
<p>As if reading her thoughts, the colonel pointed down
at the ocean of treetops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nature has been kind to us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All that you
see in the foreground is tops of giant trees. Beneath these
trees lies an extended plateau. In secret, working day and
night, we have cut away brush and small trees. In this
way we have prepared a vast temple for the gods of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secret forest,&rdquo; Gale murmured, charmed and
thrilled by the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might call it that,&rdquo; the Colonel agreed. &ldquo;Roads
have been laid out in every direction,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Roads
and airplane runways. Some of these runways are miles
long. Because of this, airplanes based at the center of the
forest may race away to spring up at the enemy far from
their base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Gale murmured. &ldquo;Those, I suppose, are
the planes I heard in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the colonel agreed. &ldquo;There has been
some fighting in the air. The Japs think we are up to
something, but don&rsquo;t know what. They send over scout
planes and some bombers that do no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly! You HAVE been up to something!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed.
&ldquo;Think of making all those roads through the
jungle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to something!&rdquo; the colonel exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say
we&rsquo;ve been up to something! As the days go by you&rsquo;ll realize
it more and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; his voice dropped&mdash;&ldquo;What I want most of
all is to impress you with the importance of your work
here. You,&rdquo;&mdash;he placed a hand on Gale&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;Are
to be the guardian angel of the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An angel?&rdquo; Gale gasped. &ldquo;Well, hardly that, colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly that,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Radar is much better than
harps for fighting wars. Harps for angels of peace, radar
for guardian angels of war.&rdquo; He laughed in a strange sort
of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; He pointed down to the forest that lay beneath
them. &ldquo;Soon beneath those trees tens of thousands of
soldiers will be sleeping, waiting for the big push. Good
American boys, they are, the kind that came from your
own home town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Yes&mdash;I know,&rdquo; Gale murmured hoarsely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Long years ago,&rdquo; the colonel went on, &ldquo;wars were
fought by professional soldiers, men from every land, hired
to fight. Even in our Civil War, if you had money and
didn&rsquo;t want to go when you were called, you could pay
someone to take your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in this war it&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; Gale agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
boy who used to work in the Post Office, and the one who
sat across from you in school, all kinds of boys who were
your playmates and pals who have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, yes!&rdquo; Jan put in. &ldquo;And then they think it&rsquo;s
funny that some of us girls want to drive a truck in the
war, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll change their ideas about that,&rdquo; the colonel
replied soberly. &ldquo;They ARE changing them now. You girls
can help. That&rsquo;s part of the reason why I brought you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I was starting to say,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;was that
you&rsquo;re up here like an all-seeing eye, Gale. Below you in
that great forest will be thousands on thousands of splendid
boys, ready, if need be, to give their lives for their
country when the big push comes. And here you are, with
radar eyes that can see in daylight or dark, clouds or sunshine,
three hundred miles or more. When enemy planes
come this way looking for those boys, you&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Gale replied solemnly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your equipment is the best,&rdquo; the colonel went on.
&ldquo;We ran a line up here so you won&rsquo;t lack power. You have
a phone and a radio for sounding a warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here,&mdash;&rdquo; he pulled a cord, letting in a flood of
light from above&mdash;&ldquo;Here is your lookout above, in case
the enemy is overhead. You&rsquo;ll only open this on special
occasions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;If things get too dangerous, you&rsquo;ll take a few steps
down, and&mdash;&rdquo; he led the way&mdash;&ldquo;this is your refuge.&rdquo; They
went down a narrow stone stairway to at last step into a
cavern cut from the solid rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure glad to see this place.
I was getting all covered with goose pimples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Gale, she gave the rock-hewn room only a quick
glance. All that interested and inspired her was in the
room above,&mdash;her radar set, radio and phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see,&rdquo; said the colonel after studying her face,
&ldquo;that the boys down there will have a guardian angel who
never fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it,&rdquo; Gale replied, with deep conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the colonel added, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want you
to feel that the burden is all yours. That would be too
much. You are not alone. There are other radar watchers
along this ridge. But yours is the key position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be guarded well!&rdquo; Gale promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, yes!&rdquo; &ldquo;With our lives!&rdquo; Jan, who could not tell
a radar set from a radiator added her bit, and they all
laughed.</p>
<p>A moment later the colonel was gone, and Gale had lost
herself in the study of her radar set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How grand!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;This is new, but I have
studied about it. It goes like this.&rdquo; She turned on a
switch, and the set began to humm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jan!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What a lovely time we could
have up here if it wasn&rsquo;t for the war and all the terrible
responsibility it brings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it the truth!&rdquo; Jan agreed.</p>
<p>Gale had not exaggerated. The view from their window,
the one that faced the world and Burma, was truly
magnificent. The sea of waving green that was tree-tops,
the hills beyond where morning mist still slowly drifted in
the wind and the green valleys far beyond&mdash;was all like a
picture painted by some famous artist.</p>
<p>But the view over head? Ah, that was different. Just
now it was blank, Gale knew. At night stars would hang
above them, and at times the moon would look in upon
them. But always there was the chance that some spy
would search out their high lonely post and mark it on a
map. She thought once more of the woman in purple, the
black dwarf and the three secrets of radar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our hideout is marked on their map,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;then our view overhead will be horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she closed her eyes she seemed to see soaring planes
that, banking steeply, came shooting down. And after
that the falling dots that grew and grew and grew. &ldquo;The
dots that scream like demons and at last roar like explosions
in hell,&rdquo;&mdash;she found herself thinking over words
that Jimmie had once spoken to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where Jimmie is now,&rdquo; she mused. Soon
enough she was to know.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the meantime Isabelle had met with a happy surprise.
In high school she had been an &ldquo;A&rdquo; grade student,
a real worker. Probably that was why she was the colonel&rsquo;s
yeoman now. She had learned to make a perfect job of
everything, and hadn&rsquo;t forgotten how.</p>
<p>There were times in those half-forgotten days when
she had wished she were different. Those were the times
when at school parties the smooth boys passed her up for
girls with a light touch, an easy laugh and plenty of &ldquo;blue
slips&rdquo; along with their grades.</p>
<p>But Isabelle hadn&rsquo;t worried too much about that, for
the smooth boys made her a little weary. She liked the
rough kind, and one boy above all others was just that. He
even had a rough and rugged name&mdash;Pete Sikes. Pete was
a redhead and his hair was always in a tangle. He had
freckles, wore a broad grin, was six feet three, and could
throw a forward pass farther and straighter than anyone
in the league. And when it came his turn to carry the
ball he simply faded into the growing dusk.</p>
<p>Pete had on weak point&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t quite all there&mdash;at
least his football togs never were. He would come to the
game minus a shoe, a helmet, or even a pair of pants.</p>
<p>That was where Isabelle came in. Because she was good
at looking after things and needed the money, she had
worked at the school office after hours. That was how she
knew just what Pete had left behind each time he went
to the football field for a game, and why she came rushing
to the grounds in a taxi&mdash;hired by herself&mdash;to slip under
the ropes and somehow get a package to Pete.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Pete was bashful, so he&rsquo;d just blush and mumble,&mdash;&ldquo;Thunder!
Isabelle, if it wasn&rsquo;t for you I&rsquo;d be playing
football in my shirt and shorts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t know that Isabelle was crazy about him&mdash;that
she longed to untangle that mass of red hair and do a
lot of other nice things for him. So commencement came
and went. Pete went with it, and she had lost him. Forever?</p>
<p>Well, it had looked that way until that day the colonel
took Gale to her new location. Since the colonel was
away, Isabelle was on her own, and was wandering in and
out among the great teakwood trees when she ran squarely
into a tall, grinning, redheaded sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete! You old rascal!&rdquo; she exclaimed, bracing herself
to avoid making a grand rush that would have ended in
something quite startling to Pete. &ldquo;How did you ever get
here?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&mdash;by boat, train, automobile and foot,&rdquo; he grinned.
Then he said a whole lot, for Pete. What he said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thunder! Isabelle! It&rsquo;s certainly good to see you here!
Any American gal would look good to any of us doughboys,
but you, Isabelle&mdash;you&rsquo;re just tops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were tears in Isabelle&rsquo;s eyes, and a rare smile on
her face just then, but all she said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete! What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for a parking lot location,&rdquo; was the surprising
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Pete! You&rsquo;re in the army!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Oh, sure!&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got to get a parking
place for a thunderin&rsquo; lot of army tanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tanks? Oh, yes! Tanks!&rdquo; Isabelle stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a gunner in a General Sherman tank,&rdquo; Pete confided,
coming in close and speaking softly. &ldquo;And Isabelle,
believe it or not, I can put those big shells just any place
I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like you used to put the old pigskins into some
player&rsquo;s mitt!&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, Pete! You&rsquo;re
wonderful! You always were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There might have been much more of this, but just then
an orderly hurried up to announce that the colonel would
soon be at his headquarters and would Isabelle please
hurry back. So all she could say was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, goodbye, Pete. It&rsquo;s been swell seeing you
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Pete, because he was Pete, said nothing at all. But
Isabelle had not heard the last of him. Far from that. Not
that she wished to hear the last of him. Far from that too.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>An Enemy at Her Window</i></span></h2>
<p>For Gale, that day passed quietly, but the night offered
a thrill, sudden joy, and grave misgivings.</p>
<p>Three times during the day her long electric radar
fingers reached out to touch metal floating in the sky.
Three times, with quickening pulse, she followed these a
hundred, two hundred miles away, but each time they
moved in a leisurely manner over the distant landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just some enemy scout planes watching over their own
troop concentrations,&rdquo; she said to Jan. &ldquo;No need to report
them. They&rsquo;re not headed this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after nightfall, very reluctantly she yielded her
post to a smiling young sergeant who was to take over for
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice quiet day.&rdquo; He smiled again as he looked over
her report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, but not nice,&rdquo; was her quick response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you crave action!&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get that
soon enough, or I miss my guess. Big doings just ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s comment as she drew on
her jacket. &ldquo;Well, goodnight and good hunting. I&rsquo;ll see
you just before dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wish you were staying longer,&rdquo; he said, with a quiet
smile. &ldquo;I like company. We don&rsquo;t see many bright-eyed
American girls over here. This WAC idea is the berries, if
you ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you like us,&rdquo; said Gale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, yes!&rdquo; Jan agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders are orders,&rdquo; said Gale in a friendly voice.
&ldquo;Going is just as much a part of our job as coming, so once
more, goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she and Jan went down the steep rocky stairway
to at last climb into their jeep and rattle away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice world,&rdquo; Gale murmured. &ldquo;Everybody is just
swell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, yes!&rdquo; Jan agreed heartily.</p>
<p>It was in the late evening as she wandered among the
shadows not too far from her own tent that glowed faintly
from a light by which Isabelle was writing letters, that
Gale got her big surprise.</p>
<p>All of a sudden a voice whispered hoarsely: &ldquo;Hi there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the instant she knew who it was. &ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; she exclaimed
softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you! How in the world did you get
here? I thought you were out over Hell&rsquo;s Half Hour, or
some other terrible place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo; He guided her to a seat on an
outgrowing root of a huge tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I completed that last mission&mdash;the big four-motored
job, you know,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loaded with bombs,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. It was a swell trip. Those bombs helped win a
Chinese battle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that grand, Jimmie!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But now,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice changed&mdash;&ldquo;Now
I&rsquo;ve been pulled off that convoy job and am part of
the big push. It&rsquo;s a grand layout here,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Best I
have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, Jimmie?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped. &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he whispered,
&ldquo;This is secret. But I know a girl who can be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me if you ought not to,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;But what you do tell me will be locked up tight in my
memory and my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your heart! That&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; He pressed her hand.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the safest place in all the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on after a moment, &ldquo;Since the colonel
led his ragged little army out of Burma&mdash;that was at
the start of the rainy season, months ago&mdash;he&rsquo;s been planning
and working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;They told him this ridge couldn&rsquo;t
be crossed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he and his ragged band crossed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Then they told him it would take years to make
a road into Burma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he said, &lsquo;Only a few months.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s just how
long it&rsquo;s been!&rdquo; Jimmie drew in a long, deep breath. &ldquo;And
now look! There&rsquo;s a road up one side of the ridge and
down the other side&mdash;a road the Japs don&rsquo;t know a thing
about. That&rsquo;s not all. This great forest has been cleared
of brush.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are roads all through it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and miles of airplane runways. Our air base is
in the heart of the forest. When there is an air raid alarm
we can come popping out at them from north, south or
west. They have no way of knowing where to drop their
bombs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jimmie!&rdquo; she exclaimed softly. &ldquo;Do you mean
that you are flying a fighting plane now, and will be going
out after the Japs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Why not?&rdquo; He laughed quietly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my job.
I&rsquo;ve got the swellest little fighting kite you ever want to
see. It&rsquo;s a new type. You&rsquo;ll be able to recognize it if you
have a field glass. You see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jimmie! That&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; she broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s terrible?&rdquo; His voice showed his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I spot some Jap bombers coming this way and send
out an alarm, I&rsquo;ll practically be calling you out to fight
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Why not? I&rsquo;ll never be called by a finer gal.&rdquo; He
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I suppose that&rsquo;s what you think,&rdquo; she replied
slowly, solemnly. &ldquo;And&mdash;and I like you for saying that.
But it would be hard to watch you being shot from the
sky and to know that I was the one who called you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Japs won&rsquo;t get me,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;That little kite
of mine is really fast. Besides, if they had any such luck,
you&rsquo;d see my parachute blossom in the sky. I&rsquo;m really
good with a parachute. And AM I!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, Jimmie,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a lot more to it than that.&rdquo; Jimmie sat up
straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; She caught his sense of thrill. &ldquo;The
whole army is coming here to camp beneath these trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tanks, guns, and fighting men. That&rsquo;s why we must
defend this forest,&rdquo; he replied in a tight, tense voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jimmie. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m to be cooped up there
on the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be for long,&rdquo; Jimmie predicted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of
that. The army will go forward to victory and we&rsquo;ll go
with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burma, China, and then, Tokio,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo; She stood up. &ldquo;Well, I have to be out
there on the ridge before dawn. I&rsquo;ll be seeing you.&rdquo; She
held out a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow,&rdquo; was his reply. And tomorrow it
was.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It was mid-afternoon of the next day. Gale had given
her entire equipment a routine checkup and had sent her
radar feelers out into the thin air of a bright, sunshiney
day, when she gave a sudden start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Jan exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, just yet,&rdquo; was the slow reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something in the air out there far beyond where we can
see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a hundred and fifty miles. Patrol planes&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you think?&rdquo; Jan settled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s excited reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not
just one or two of them&mdash;more nearly a hundred, I&rsquo;d say.
I get them over quite a wide area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several minutes the suppressed silence lay over the
lookout station. Then Gale let out a whoop: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
coming this way&mdash;the whole lot of them&mdash;maintaining a
uniform speed, too. Must be flying in formation. Get
headquarters, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan sprang to the phone. Half a minute later Jan said:
&ldquo;Here you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale&rsquo;s hand trembled as she picked up the receiver.
&ldquo;Headquarters?&rdquo; she said in a calm voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! This is G. G. J. speaking. Wish to report large
formation of enemy planes due east from this station&mdash;a
hundred or more miles away. Flying west at identical
speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formation,&rdquo; said the voice at the other end, &ldquo;may be
practice flight. Keep on them and report again in three
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale obeyed orders. In exactly three minutes she was
back on the phone. &ldquo;Formation of enemy planes still
traveling west,&rdquo; was her report. &ldquo;Maintaining identical
and uniform speed. Think they can be seen as a dark spot
on the horizon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. We&rsquo;ll check on that and send out scout planes.&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;Keep your radar on them. Report at
intervals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale did keep her radar on those planes. If they were
flying to attack the secret forest or the distant city, she
had made a scoop that would be remembered.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour had not passed before she was
sure that this was indeed an enemy bombing and fighting
force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if the Japs were planning a big show,&rdquo; she
said to Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, yes!&rdquo; Jan agreed. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; She handed Gale a
pair of powerful binoculars. &ldquo;You can see them plain now,
even tell the fighters from the bombers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale was really startled when she had the formation
within her view. For a full moment she studied that mass
of flying hate. She fancied that she heard the roar of the
motors, but that was impossible.</p>
<p>After that she swept the sky with the glass. She was
looking for American planes flying out to meet them.
There were none&mdash;only two observation planes&mdash;flying
high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what that means,&rdquo; she murmured. She
thought of the crowded city she had recently left and
shuddered at thought of the death and destruction
that would follow if those planes got through. &ldquo;They
may be planning to attack the secret forest,&rdquo; she said
to Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they know about it?&rdquo; Jan asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Who can tell?&rdquo; Gale replied slowly. &ldquo;Little
good that would do them now. That forest is as long as one
of our states, and quite wide. There are only a few of us
billetted there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure! They&rsquo;d never find us!&rdquo; Jan was at ease again.
But not for long.</p>
<p>Gale got her answer to the question regarding the absence
of U. S. fighter planes. Long after she had given up
hope, when the formation of enemy bombers and fighters
were all but over the forest, all of a sudden, seeming to
come from every side at once, a great flight of U. S.
fighters filled the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed in wild excitement. &ldquo;Now
there will be a big battle before our very eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moments that followed will live long in Gale&rsquo;s
memory. Swarms of American flyers filled the sky. To her
this was no mystery. To the enemy pilots it all must have
seemed a feat of magic.</p>
<p>From the direction they had been taking, it seemed
evident to Gale that the enemy bombers had not been
bound for the secret forest but for the crowded city far
beyond. Whatever their destination may have been, they
were at once driven off their course and when the battle
began in earnest though still some distance away, they
were directly in front of her lookout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed, dancing about. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like
they were putting on a show for our benefit!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Gale did not reply. She was busy, but not with her instrument&mdash;her
task for that day was done&mdash;the enemy did
not now need to be spotted&mdash;he was here.</p>
<p>With her powerful binoculars she was sweeping the
sky looking for just one plane. She would know it when
she saw it. It was the smallest, fastest U. S. plane of them
all. It had a sharp nose, and long, slender wings like those
of a nightingale. &ldquo;And a Nightingale flies it,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;&mdash;Jimmie Nightingale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truth is she did not wish to find it there in the sky.
She had hoped Jimmie was far away on some other
mission, for this would be a fearful battle. The enemy
bombers were heavily armed and had a powerful fighter
escort.</p>
<p>Just when she was hoping that she had seen all the
planes and could assure herself that Jimmie was not there,
a very small fighter plane with narrow wings came out
from behind some enemy bombers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There he is! Oh, Jimmie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Where is he?&rdquo; Jan exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in front of those four bombers over to the left,&rdquo;
Gale pointed him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Yes! I see him!&rdquo; Jan replied, breathlessly.</p>
<p>Just then, as if he was conscious of being watched and
felt the need of putting on a show, which of course he did
not, Jimmie seemed to leap straight at the nearest enemy
bomber. With his guns spouting fire, he flew squarely under
the enemy plane&rsquo;s motors. At once the enemy bomber&rsquo;s
right motor began to smoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Ten seconds later Jimmie was back. Now it was the
right motor that received his hail of bullets. Turning
slowly, like a leaf in the wind, the bomber rolled over on
its side, then went into a spin. A moment later it struck
a ledge and exploded with a terrific roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;Suppose that one had fallen
on our little coop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re afraid,&rdquo; Gale suggested, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
go into our shelter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I wouldn&rsquo;t! Not for worlds!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed.</p>
<p>But now it seemed that Jimmie was in trouble. In revenge
for their lost bomber, three enemy fighters had gone
after him. Lightly armed, speedy planes, these Jap Zeroes
were dangerous enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Jimmie! Watch out!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed, unconscious
of what she was saying in her excitement.</p>
<p>With the three Zeroes hot on his tail, Jimmie went into
a power-dive that was like nothing Gale had ever seen
before. By the time she had caught her breath, she saw his
plane sweep into a steep spiral curve to come up behind
one of the Zeroes and send it down in flames.</p>
<p>Before Jimmie could swing into a safe position, a Zero
got in a burst of fire that made his plane stagger, but he
was up and at them with such speed that a second plane
was sent spinning earthward.</p>
<p>Just when the third Zero, in what appeared to be a suicide
attack, leapt squarely at Jimmie&rsquo;s plane, the whole
picture disappeared, and the room went dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jan!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed in sudden desperation, &ldquo;What
has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you deaf?&rdquo; was the startling reply. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale did listen, and to her waiting ears, above the sound
of battle, came the roar of a single plane close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Zero plane,&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;Perhaps he carries
a bomb. He may have seen the sunshine on our window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jan had drawn the thick shade outside their window,
but there remained a small crack. Just as Gale peeked
through this crack, the enemy plane passed so close she
saw the flyer&rsquo;s ugly face. Did he look her way? She imagined
that he did. For a second he was there, then he
was gone for good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone this time,&rdquo; she shuddered, &ldquo;But what about next
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who could answer? Had the pilot of that plane really
spotted their hideout and guessed its purpose? For the
present there was nothing left but to carry on.</p>
<p>When Gale opened the window a wider crack to fix her
binoculars on the few remaining fighters, Jimmie&rsquo;s small
plane with the slender wings was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was shot down,&rdquo; she thought in sudden panic. Of
this she could not be sure. Nothing is certain in war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>A Monstrous Procession</i></span></h2>
<p>Slowly the sound of battle faded away in the distance.
With fingers that trembled violently, Gale drew the blind
before her window aside and started her radar set working
again.</p>
<p>Now instead of a great formation of enemy planes advancing
upon her, she picked up one here, another there,
and always rapidly fading off into the distant sky. Now
and then she caught sudden movements of planes, indicating
that some daring American fighters were still
after the retreating enemy. Was Jimmie one of these? She
dared hope a little, but not too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;Was that a battle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great defeat for the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be praised for that,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s solemn comment.
&ldquo;More than half their bombers must have been shot down.
The others dropped their bombs where they did no harm,
and fled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did some of their fighters get away?&rdquo; Jan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Several of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo; Jan&rsquo;s knees trembled. &ldquo;It scares me. I&rsquo;m
funny, I guess. I could drive a jeep almost over a precipice
and not be scared at all. But just to think of a bomb
dropping on me, that&rsquo;s terrible! There would be nothing
left of me,&mdash;just nothing at all. But if that Jap in the
fighter plane spotted us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s quiet reply. &ldquo;Besides,
something tells me we won&rsquo;t be here much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What makes you think that?&rdquo; Jan asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colonel wouldn&rsquo;t have sent out all those planes to
attack the Jap bombers if this was to be an important point
much longer. That&rsquo;s sure to tip them off to the fact that
there&rsquo;s something big around here somewhere. They&rsquo;ll
be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! They&rsquo;ll be back!&rdquo; Jan was more frightened than
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Snap out of it, Jan!&rdquo; Gale scolded. &ldquo;We joined up
to help fight a war! We&rsquo;re not worth much if we&rsquo;re scared
all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Jan&rsquo;s ample figure stiffened. &ldquo;Sure. That&rsquo;s right.
You can count on me in the pinches every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just right we can!&rdquo; Gale agreed.</p>
<p>At dusk, when her relief arrived, Gale asked eagerly
for news of the air battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you a thing,&rdquo; was the quick reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re not allowed to,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; said the young sergeant with a
slow smile. &ldquo;Things are terribly secret up here these days.
I&rsquo;ve been here for quite a while. With every day that
passes the officers get more nervy. There&rsquo;s something
really big in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; Gale murmured.</p>
<p>It was the same way when Gale and Jan had arrived
in the shadow of the secret forest. Isabelle, who had
awaited them at the tent, was in a fine state of excitement,
but could tell them nothing of the battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been no report given out except that it
was a great little victory for our side,&rdquo; was all she would
say.</p>
<p>When Than Shwe arrived from the hospital she reported
that three wounded aviators had been brought in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than Shwe!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you know
Jimmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That handsome fellow who called for you once at the
club?&rdquo; the little nurse asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! That was Jimmie!&rdquo; Gale caught her breath.
&ldquo;Is&mdash;is he in the hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The little nurse shook her head. &ldquo;No, your
Jimmie, he was not one of these. But really, do you think
he was shot down today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know.&rdquo; Gale&rsquo;s brow wrinkled. &ldquo;I saw
him in a terrible fight with three Jap Zeroes. His plane
was crippled, and then that was all we saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jimmie&rsquo;ll come back,&rdquo; Jan consoled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s that
kind of a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Than Shwe was to dine that night with a
Burmese officer and Jan was to eat with a truck crew that
had just arrived, Gale and Isabelle took their mess kits
and went to join in the lineup for chow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have better arrangements for you girls later,&rdquo;
the colonel had said to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; he had smiled. &ldquo;A mess hall all your own&mdash;just
for the ladies of the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might please some of them,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;but
not me. I like to feel that I am a real soldier. There&rsquo;s
a sort of comradeship that comes from standing in line with
your mess kit and cup, the boys joshing one another, and
all that. It&rsquo;s real fun. At first,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;they sort of
leave you a space by yourself&mdash;as if you were poison, or
perhaps were made of fragile stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after that?&rdquo; he grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that they find out we&rsquo;re real fellows, and take
us in. That makes me feel all sort of good inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other night,&rdquo; she had laughed, &ldquo;they started
doing a goose-step, with hands on shoulders. At first there
was no hand on my shoulder. Then there was, and I did
the goose-step with the best of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo; the colonel had enthused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the sort of thing that took my little band of boys and girls
out of Burma. Comradeship! There&rsquo;s nothing like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no goose-step on this night. The boys were a
sober lot. Perhaps the air battle of the day had warned
them that big events were just ahead.</p>
<p>Despite all this, the meal was a great success for Isabelle,
for no sooner had she joined the line than a great paw
was placed on her shoulder and a big voice said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Isabelle! How&rsquo;s things?&rdquo; It was her old schoolmate,
Pete Sikes, of the tanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale!&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed, &ldquo;this is Pete Sikes, the all-star
player of our old high school days&mdash;you&rsquo;ll like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Gale did. They ate their corned Willie, dehydrated
potatoes, tomatoes and pineapple together beneath
a great spreading tree that appeared to offer ample protection
from any attack from the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; said Isabelle, when they had finished with
home town talk, &ldquo;What do you know about the air battle
we had today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much.&rdquo; Pete wrinkled his brow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been busy. Big business tonight,&rdquo; he grinned, mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed. &ldquo;No one seems to know about
that fight. We saw it all from our coop up there in the
rocks,&mdash;that is&mdash;nearly all. I missed the part that means
the most to me. One of my friends was in the fight. He
got a bomber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Pete exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all.&rdquo; Gale went on: &ldquo;Three Zeroes went
after him. He&rsquo;d shot down two of them, but his plane had
been damaged and the third Zero was after him when Jan
pulled the curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pulled the curtain!&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. A Jap fighter flew in close to our coop. We were
afraid he&rsquo;d spot us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;When we could open up again,&rdquo;&mdash;Gale drew in a long
breath&mdash;&ldquo;Jimmie and his little fighter had vanished from
the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, that is bad,&rdquo; Pete drawled. &ldquo;Just one of
those things though&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to wait for news, that&rsquo;s
all. War is a great little waiting game. Something happens
that you want to know about, but you just have to wait.
You get all set for something big, and then again you have
to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;&rdquo; his eyes opened wide&mdash;&ldquo;If you girls
want to see something really big,&mdash;a thing you&rsquo;ll never
forget&mdash;I&rsquo;m right in position to get you a grandstand seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale looked at Isabelle. Isabelle nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Gale agreed. &ldquo;Count me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later, Gale, Isabelle and Than Shwe piled
into Pete&rsquo;s jeep and went gliding silently out from beneath
the secret forest toward some unannounced destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to leave you out here,&rdquo; Pete explained. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
have to find your own way back, thumb your way, or hoof
it. I&rsquo;ve got lots of work to do. But believe me, you&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s
worth it. It&rsquo;s not more than four miles, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think of this big goof asking us to tramp back four
miles just to see something we don&rsquo;t know a thing about!&rdquo;
Isabelle laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Pete slowed down his car. &ldquo;Want to go
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first there was no answer. &ldquo;What do you say, girls?&rdquo;
Isabelle asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s prompt reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chances. That&rsquo;s all I take all my life,&rdquo; Than Shwe
said, laughing.</p>
<p>They drove on.</p>
<p>At a point where something like a cross between a
road and a path came out into the main highway, Pete
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is as far as I go,&rdquo; Pete announced. &ldquo;The big show
passes here. There&rsquo;s the trunk of a huge dead tree just
back of those bushes. You can see it all right from there.
I&rsquo;ve a notion that you can find your way back to camp by
this trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not dead sure?&rdquo; Isabelle teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Pete agreed. &ldquo;In this man&rsquo;s war
you have to take chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They piled out. Pete turned his jeep about and sped
away. Like three night birds they perched themselves on
the fallen giant of the forest, wrapped their jackets about
them to keep out the chill mountain air, then settled down
to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be just one of Pete&rsquo;s pranks,&rdquo; Isabelle announced.
&ldquo;He was full of tricks in high school,&mdash;kept us
out in the grass hunting snipe with a gunny-sack and a
dishpan and a lantern for two hours once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is a trick,&rdquo; Gale said, &ldquo;and if we hike back
four miles for nothing, you shall be shot at midnight. I&rsquo;ve
had a hard day, and I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Than Shwe put her fingers to Gale&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>As they all sat there at the edge of the silent jungle with
the night all about them, an ominous rumble reached their
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More Jap bombers,&rdquo; Gale groaned. &ldquo;And I am not
there to help stop them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Isabelle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bombers. It&rsquo;s too tremendous
and too indistinct for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bombers,&rdquo; Than Shwe agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo; Gale demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ask me,&rdquo; said Isabelle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell you that it was
Pete&rsquo;s outfit coming into roost beneath the Secret Forest.
He&rsquo;s with the tanks, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that. Much more!&rdquo; Than Shwe sprang to
her feet to dance a jig. &ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo; Gale repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what the colonel calls &lsquo;The whole damned outfit&rsquo;.&rdquo;
Than Shwe grew vastly excited. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just tanks, but
tanks, guns, men, trucks, trucks, trucks, kitchens, food,
guns, tanks, Tommy guns, and men, men, men,&mdash;the
most soldiers you ever saw.&rdquo; Than Shwe danced all over
the place.</p>
<p>Than Shwe was right. Pete had not let them down.
They were to witness one of the most stupendous parades
ever put on in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>It began with a group of cars. Gale was not sure that
they carried officers, advance guard, or both.</p>
<p>The darkness that was all but complete&mdash;a pin-prick
of light showed here and there&mdash;only served to heighten
the parade of monsters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>After the cars came a convoy of trucks. Some of these
were closed, some open. On some of the open trucks they
made out the form of camp kitchens, on others, bent forward,
half asleep, were men,&mdash;hundreds and hundreds of
men.</p>
<p>And then came the big guns&mdash;guns on half tracks, on
trucks, and propelled by their own power they one and all
gave out a great bang and clatter. Now and then, as a gun
threatened to leave the road, there came a shout of warning.
Once the whole parade of monsters came to a jangling
halt. Then the silence was appalling.</p>
<p>For each of the three girls the effect of it all was
strangely different. Isabelle seemed stunned into silence
by it all. When the tanks which followed the guns came
clattering in, she wanted nothing so much as to cut and
run for it, and keep on running until she was back in the
quiet of the city. She had wanted to go forward to join in
the war, but this brought the tremendous reality of it all
to her in a new and awe-inspiring manner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if we
weren&rsquo;t on earth at all,&rdquo; she murmured once. &ldquo;It would
seem more real on Mars or the moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Civilization!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Than Shwe was delirious with joy. Flinging her hair
to the wind, she danced about like a woods sprite. &ldquo;The
Japs, they drive the colonel out of Burma. Now see! See
what the colonel has got! Oh! I wish I could ride into
Burma on top of a tank!&rdquo; Than Shwe was just plain mad
with joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>To Gale, that never ending procession was truly a sight
she would never forget. In her mind&rsquo;s eye she could see
them all,&mdash;men, trucks, guns and tanks moving into places
assigned to them beneath the Secret Forest. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t
be there long,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;But as long as they remain,
with my radar I shall be watching over them. Truly
I must be their guardian angel! I must not fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment though her eyes saw shadowy forms
moving forward in the night. The inner eyes of her being
were seeing boys, bright American boys she had known,
and thousands she had seen but never known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are the boys riding out there tonight,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Riding to battle.&rdquo; Again she whispered: &ldquo;I must
not fail!&rdquo; and the words of an old song seemed to sing
themselves in her mind: &ldquo;A charge to keep I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The procession was endless,&mdash;guns, tanks, trucks, men,
then more guns, tanks, trucks, men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No end to it,&rdquo; Gale whispered, sliding down from her
seat. &ldquo;Come on. We&rsquo;ve got to get back. Tomorrow I must
be there in my hideout helping to keep the Jap bombers
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete suggested this trail,&rdquo; said Isabelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to try it.&rdquo; Gale sighed. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t mingle
with tanks and guns, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, after snapping on a tiny flashlight, she led the way
straight into new and surprising adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Mysterious Temple</i></span></h2>
<p>The trail the three girls followed was strange. It was
not a road. There were no wheel tracks, and yet it was
well traveled, trodden down and smooth by years of constant
use. Here and there in soft places beside the path
they found footprints of horses and donkeys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps this is the trail the colonel and you took down
the mountain, Than Shwe,&rdquo; Isabelle suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it can be,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;This is a
good trail. Ours was horrible. We lost it more than once
because it just vanished into nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upward climb was much longer than they had
expected it to be. Gale thought that any minute they
would find themselves turning sharply to the right, then
starting down toward the Secret Forest. They did not
turn, but kept straight on up an incline that every moment
grew steeper.</p>
<p>Gale was ready to suggest that they give it up and turn
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re paying too much for our view of the parade,&rdquo;
said Isabelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed it,&rdquo; said Than Shwe. &ldquo;For now
I know we cannot fail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Gale said nothing, but trudged straight on. &ldquo;Tomorrow
is another day,&rdquo; she was thinking. &ldquo;And I must be
guardian angel for many thousands. I made a mistake by
coming, but now we must get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly they reached the crest of the ridge. &ldquo;Oh! This
is better.&rdquo; Gale sighed. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll follow along the ridge
a little way and then start down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no trail along the crest of the ridge, only
scrub trees and rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look.&rdquo; Isabelle flashed on her light. &ldquo;The trail goes
over the ridge and down on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong direction,&rdquo; Gale groaned. &ldquo;If we go that way
we&rsquo;ll never reach our forest, Isabelle. That Pete of yours
is some little trail blazer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Than Shwe, who had made her way around
an immense rock, called softly to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls! Come see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had reached her side they stood staring in
amazement, for there beneath them, seeming so close in
the moonlight that Gale half fancied she could step on
its roof, stood a Buddhist temple surrounded by a high
wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s the reason for the trail!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed.
&ldquo;What a strange place for a temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a monastery where Buddhist monks live,&rdquo; Than
Shwe explained. &ldquo;They are everywhere, these monks.
Perhaps there are native villages not too far away, or a
trail where people may get lost. They are like your Christian
monks in the high Alps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is always a gate keeper,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;They
may have a trail to the Secret Forest. It is but a little way.
We might go down and ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth trying,&rdquo; Gale agreed. And so they took to
the trail again.</p>
<p>They had covered two-thirds of the distance when
Gale, who was in the lead, came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;A woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed at a window of the temple that could be
seen above the wall. There was a light in the room.
Through the window they saw a tall woman. She was
combing her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not strange,&rdquo; Than Shwe whispered back.
&ldquo;Everyone is welcome to spend a night in one of these
temples. They make a little offering in the morning, or
perhaps a very good one if they are rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that woman looks familiar.&rdquo; Gale did not move.
Taking a small pair of binoculars from her pocket, she
studied the scene, the temple, the window and the
woman standing at a crude dressing table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is eavesdropping,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;All the same
it must be excusable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely ten seconds later, barely
avoiding dropping her glasses. &ldquo;Yes! It surely is.&rdquo; Then
she whispered four startling words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman in purple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look.&rdquo; Than Shwe took the glass while they all
shrank deeper into the shadows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>Than Shwe studied the woman and her surroundings
for some time. When at last she returned the glasses to
their owner, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very bad woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Do you know her?&rdquo; Gale whispered in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! For a long time.&rdquo; Than Shwe shrank still
deeper into the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is called Madam Stark, and comes from India, but
she lived a long time in Burma. She is very dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Stark is an English name,&rdquo; Gale whispered in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She married a very rich English trader. He was
not a good man. There are bad men from every land.
They say he traded in opium. He treated her badly. That
is why she hates all English people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she really a spy?&rdquo; Gale asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I do not know,&rdquo; Than Shwe pondered. &ldquo;Perhaps
she may be. Anyway she did great harm in Burma. She
paid men to wreck bridges and tear up railway tracks
when the British army was coming. She was in China,
too. Oh yes! And she was a bad one there! We have a
Chinese nurse, Maida, at our hospital here. She knows
about her in China. She will tell you plenty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo;&mdash;the little Burmese girl&rsquo;s whisper changed.
&ldquo;Look. On her dressing table she has a dresser set that
seems very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting the glasses once more to her eyes Gale stared
in silence for a long time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;That IS a strange collection,
stranger than you think, Than Shwe.&rdquo; She seemed greatly
excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look,&rdquo; Isabelle whispered, naming the articles
in the leather case as she looked&mdash;&ldquo;The comb is missing.
She is using it; a nail buffer; sharp pointed dagger; nail
file; little blue automatic pistol; shoe horn, and&mdash;and
something else I can&rsquo;t make out. I&rsquo;d hate to meet that lady
in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; Than Shwe agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that &lsquo;something else&rsquo; is the most important of all,
unless I miss my guess,&rdquo; Gale put in. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be quite
sure, but I think it&rsquo;s one of the three secrets of radar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secrets of radar!&rdquo; Isabelle whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Isabelle. Don&rsquo;t you know how, after my radar set
had been blown up, I looked so long for the three parts
that might give our secrets away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. You found two of them, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the third was gone. It was while I was looking
for those parts that I first saw that woman in purple. She
too appeared to be looking for something. I always have
thought that she found that part. I am almost sure of it
now. It would be terrible if she succeeded in getting all
three secret parts. The Jap&rsquo;s radar is a poor one, but with
those secrets&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be shooting down our planes in the fog and
the dark,&rdquo; said Isabelle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they would. Tell you what!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed
in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;I am going down there and
demand the right to see the contents of that case!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Isabelle whispered. Her eyes were on the
dagger and the automatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not get inside the walls,&rdquo; said Than Shwe.
&ldquo;At sundown the gates are locked. They are opened only
at sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a day&rsquo;s work waiting for each of us!&rdquo;
Isabelle suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! A day&rsquo;s work!&rdquo; Gale murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll report
this to the colonel or the army intelligence office first
thing tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes sense,&rdquo; Isabelle agreed. &ldquo;Only you&rsquo;ll have
to leave the reporting to me&mdash;your day starts too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are we to do just now?&rdquo; Gale sank to a seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down and thumb a ride in the giants&rsquo; parade,&rdquo;
said Isabelle. &ldquo;That at least will be an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrilling,&rdquo; Gale agreed. &ldquo;Well, what are we waiting
for?&rdquo; She prepared to lead on the return march.</p>
<p>They made their way down the ridge in half the time
it took to go up. Then again, this time, quite unwillingly
they witnessed the colonel&rsquo;s grand parade.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes after their arrival the parade came to
a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed, dashing for a truck.
&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our chance!&rdquo; Arrived at the back of the truck, she
pulled at a canvas flap. It gave way, letting out a flood of
light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What?&rdquo; a boyish voice began. Then the voice
rose: &ldquo;Jeepers! Girls! Can you tie that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a couple of WACS and a nurse,&rdquo; Gale grinned.
&ldquo;How about bumming a ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Hop in! Crowd over, you fellows. It&rsquo;s not always
we ride with ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not exactly ladies,&rdquo; said Gale when they had
found their places and the flap was closed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re soldiers,
same as you are, in for the duration. My friend
Isabelle here is the colonel&rsquo;s yeoman, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about that!&rdquo; one of the boys exclaimed.
&ldquo;Think of meeting the colonel&rsquo;s yeoman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Isabelle!&rdquo; another boy exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
this war. Not enough fun. I want to go home. Fix it up
with the colonel, will you?&rdquo; The boys all laughed.</p>
<p>The question required no answer, so Gale went on:
&ldquo;This nurse, Than Shwe, came over the mountains with
the colonel on his retreat. Now she&rsquo;s going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to us Than Whatever!&rdquo; exclaimed a burly
redhead. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cut a wide path for you all the way to
China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; the little Burmese girl chimed in. &ldquo;And
if you stub your toe or something, come to my hospital.
I&rsquo;ll fix you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! You&rsquo;ve been up there ahead!&rdquo; another boy exclaimed.
&ldquo;What sort of a place is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Swell,&rdquo; said Isabelle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a forest of immense trees
and it&rsquo;s big enough to hide the whole army. But you won&rsquo;t
be there long, and neither will we. We travel with the
colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And boy! Does he ever travel fast!&rdquo; exclaimed a boy
with a Cumberland Mountain accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re in the Secret Forest I am to be your
guardian angel,&rdquo; said Gale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you an angel?&rdquo; someone exclaimed. This called
for one more laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not quite,&rdquo; Gale replied when the laugh was
over. &ldquo;I sit in a box among the rocks and watch for
naughty Jap planes that might bomb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a spyglass?&rdquo; One boy was impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With radar. That&rsquo;s lots better,&rdquo; Gale explained. &ldquo;I
can spot them two hundred miles away. I send in a report
and our fighters go out to meet them. We had a grand
scrap today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat the livin&rsquo; daylights out o&rsquo; &rsquo;em? Huh?&rdquo; said a
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we did. It was grand, only&mdash;&rdquo; Gale
hesitated. &ldquo;Only I&rsquo;m afraid the Japs got one of my friends,
Jimmie Nightingale. He was a Flying Tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie Nightingale!&rdquo; a dark eyed youth exclaimed.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s from my home town, and no kidding. He&rsquo;s
one swell guy. But say, sister, if you think any dirty
Jap got Jimmie you&rsquo;ve got one more guess coming, believe
me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>And so amid laughter, vague fears and words of cheer
the three girls rode home to their Secret Forest with one
little corner of the grandest army the world has ever
known.</p>
<p>When at the edge of the forest the truck once again
came to a halt, the tired trio tumbled out amid the low
cheers of their hosts, and raced away to their tent where
they drowned the day&rsquo;s adventures in a batch of sleep.</p>
<p>And the morrow was another day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>The Lady Barber Quartette</i></span></h2>
<p>The following morning when just before dawn Gale
and Jan wound in and out among the trees of the Secret
Forest on their way to work, it seemed as if they were in
another world. Where yesterday only moss and ferns
could be seen, tents had blossomed in abundance. Beside
these stood tanks and trucks.</p>
<p>Here and there they passed sleepy sentries. These
saluted them with a wave and a friendly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They like us!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;Golly! Ain&rsquo;t that
swell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your figure they like,&rdquo; Gale laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&mdash;sure,&rdquo; Jan agreed. &ldquo;Fine and sturdy.&rdquo; You
couldn&rsquo;t get Jan&rsquo;s goat.</p>
<p>Further on they passed a portable kitchen that gave off
pungent odors of burning wood, frying ham and brewing
coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm!&rdquo; Jan sniffed. &ldquo;Good old Virginia hickory-smoked
ham! Let&rsquo;s stop for breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have toast, and coffee from a bottle, same as
usual,&rdquo; Gale replied grimly. &ldquo;This is the most important
day of our lives thus far. Think what it would mean if a
big formation of enemy bombers flew over and dropped
their hate on all this.&rdquo; She swung her arms wide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Despite her fears, Gale passed a quiet day in her hideout
on the ridge. Twice she thought she had picked up
the scent of a wolf-pack of enemy planes coming her way,
but both times the scent faded and she knew that her
fears were not well founded.</p>
<p>Just at sunset she received a sudden shock. With the
skies all clear and no sight of enemies about, she stepped
out on the rocky ledge for a breath of air. She had not
been there a minute when on a ridge fully half a mile
away, she spied a lone figure walking slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no soldier,&rdquo; she told herself, lifting binoculars to
her eyes. &ldquo;Some native in a long, black robe,&rdquo; she decided.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she caught her breath&mdash;&ldquo;he walks as if he were a
little lame in both feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant, as if he had caught a flash of light from
her glasses, as indeed he might have done, the lone walker
quickened his strange, halting steps to disappear behind
the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; Gale said to Jan a moment later. &ldquo;Twice
before I have seen such a man,&mdash;once up there in the
temple at the edge of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the one who locked Isabelle in the room of
Absolute Silence and tried to poison you with incense
fumes,&rdquo; Jan suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we thought,&rdquo; Gale said. &ldquo;Of course, we
couldn&rsquo;t prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other time he was with the woman in purple,&rdquo;
said Jan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Can you tie that! Last night it was the
woman in purple we saw in a temple! And now it&rsquo;s the
two-legged cripple again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if they were shadowing us,&rdquo; said Jan with a
shudder. &ldquo;Gives me the willies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get shadowed,&rdquo; Gale declared. &ldquo;Isabelle probably
has set the army intelligence service on them by
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the colonel,&rdquo; said Jan. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later they found themselves once more riding
in the shadows of the Secret Forest.</p>
<p>They were met at the tent door by a tremendously excited
Isabelle. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Get cleaned
up, quick! You won&rsquo;t have much time for chow. Here! I
brought you a huge can of coffee and I&rsquo;ve made you some
marmalade sandwiches. You&rsquo;ll just have time to gulp
them down and get into your costumes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Costumes!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed, catching Isabelle&rsquo;s excitement,&mdash;&ldquo;You
mean uniforms, don&rsquo;t you? Does the big
push into Burma really start right now, and are we to go
with the army? Oh! Glory be! Yippy!&rdquo; She was fairly
dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said anything about the big push?&rdquo; Isabelle demanded.
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mean uniforms. I said costumes,
and I mean our barber costumes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barber costumes! Oh! Good grief!&rdquo; Gale sat down
quite suddenly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you brought those
things along!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the colonel&rsquo;s request,&rdquo; Isabelle nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the colonel!&rdquo; Jan exploded. &ldquo;He never saw us do
that skit back there at the Club in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you think!&rdquo; Than Shwe put in. &ldquo;What
the colonel doesn&rsquo;t see isn&rsquo;t worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colonel slid into a back seat the night of the Club
entertainment when we did our Lady Barber Quartette
feature,&rdquo; Isabelle explained. &ldquo;He liked it, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we are to do it for his entire army, I suppose!&rdquo; Gale
did an imitation collapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really a big army,&rdquo; Isabelle defended. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think there are more than twenty thousand. There&rsquo;s a
much larger army striking at the Japs from another direction,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the next spot on our barn-storming tour,&rdquo;
Gale exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Isabelle replied quietly. &ldquo;Truth is,&rdquo;
she admitted, &ldquo;I too had my misgivings. Jan is such a
clown! She&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I am, am I!&rdquo; Jan exploded. &ldquo;Just for that I&rsquo;ll do
the skit alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you&rsquo;ll not!&rdquo; Gale stormed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s got to be
a little dignity to our part of the outfit, even if we are a
small group.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you two.&rdquo; Than Shwe held out steaming cups of
coffee to Jan and Gale. &ldquo;Drink these and quiet down. You
know what the colonel wants he&rsquo;s going to have. Besides,
he brought you three WACS along when it was against
the rules, and if you&rsquo;re not nice little girls he can send
you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Gale agreed after burning her tongue on the
coffee, &ldquo;is the plain unvarnished truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of which meant that at one of the home talent
shows given by army women at the Club for women only
back there in India, the four jolly comrades, led by Gale,
had dressed up in barber&rsquo;s coats and slacks, with combs
behind their ears, and had put on a Lady Barber Quartette
stunt. Jan, who blacked her face and sang as the bootblack
of the shop, had nearly stolen the show. It had been quite
a success. The colonel had seen and liked it, so there they
were, confronted with the prospect of doing their stunt
all over again before thousands of khaki-clad boys from
the old USA, a breath taking adventure if ever there was
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go through a bombing,&rdquo; Gale declared. &ldquo;But
what the colonel wants is what he&rsquo;s going to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene that lay before them when, after coming up
a ridge the back way and entering the impromptu dressing-room&mdash;an
army tent&mdash;and then taking their places on
a board platform backed by a sounding-board, was one
they would not soon forget. The platform had been
erected on a broad rock facing a hillside that rose like the
tiers of seats in an opera house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seats for twenty thousand, and every seat taken,&rdquo;
Isabelle whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>This, Gale thought, must be true. She found herself
looking into a sea of faces. &ldquo;The colonel&rsquo;s army.&rdquo; She
swallowed hard. &ldquo;Thousands of nice boys from my own
native land. Tonight they are here to be entertained, and
tomorrow, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; She closed her eyes on the morrow.</p>
<p>There were other features than theirs on the program.
All the participants were on the stage.</p>
<p>When the great throng stood up, when some soldiers
struck the chords of Star Spangled Banner and those men,
twenty thousand of them, roared out the national anthem,
Gale felt her soul lifted to the stars that shone above the
treetops.</p>
<p>The colonel stepped to the microphone and like a football
coach before the big game of the season, gave the boys
a pep-talk that was brief as it was impressive.</p>
<p>A band swarmed onto the platform and played two
stirring marches. The boys roared their approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;re next,&rdquo; Gale gulped as the band trooped
off.</p>
<p>The colonel announced them only as the Barber Shop
Quartette. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re boys,&rdquo; Jan whispered.</p>
<p>They sang Sweet Adeline, giving it everything.</p>
<p>There came a scattered applause. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a flop!&rdquo; Gale
thought.</p>
<p>Then a big rawboned tank sergeant from the deep
south, who had somehow made a surprising discovery,
stood up to roar:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! You guys! Them&rsquo;s gals! How about givin&rsquo; &rsquo;em a
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>The applause was as great as the look of surprise on ten
thousand faces.</p>
<p>Enheartened, Gale proposed a glorious song that had
been the prime favorite of another war.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a long, long trail a-winding</p>
<p class="t0">Into the land of my dreams,&rdquo; they sang.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Where the nightingales are singing</p>
<p class="t0">And the white moon beams.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps most of those boys had never heard that song.
Perhaps in the hearts of the singers was the same old deep
longing that hung over all of the Secret Forest. However
that may have been, when the song ended&mdash;&ldquo;Till the day
when I&rsquo;ll be walking down that long, long trail with you,&rdquo;
every boy was on his feet with a shout of approval.</p>
<p>It had been planned that Jan should sing a solo, dressed
as a ragged colored man. &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t! I just can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she
wailed when they were back in the dressing room and the
band was back on the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll wow them!&rdquo; Gale insisted.</p>
<p>And so, ten minutes later, dressed in a coat two sizes
too large, striped trousers and plug hat, leaning on a cane,
Jan slipped out on the platform alone. For ten seconds
there was silence. Then a roar shook the treetops.</p>
<p>Jan had a strange voice. It wasn&rsquo;t basso or tenor. It
wasn&rsquo;t contralto. Just a voice singing in a wilderness. But
when she began to sing &ldquo;Old Man River&rdquo; there was absolute
silence. When she sang on, rolling her eyes and
swaying like a rolling river,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;That old man river, he must know something</p>
<p class="t0">But he don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">He jes&rsquo; goes rolling along,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>the silence continued.</p>
<p>When she sang,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired of livin&rsquo; an&rsquo; feared o&rsquo; dying,&rdquo; a great silence
hung over the forest.</p>
<p>But when she finished, that forest exploded just as truly
as it would have had the Japs staged an air raid.</p>
<p>Nothing would do after that short of an encore. So
leaning on her cane, Jan sang: &ldquo;Old Black Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps that song has been rendered in a better manner
ten thousand times before, but you&rsquo;d never convince those
soldiers of that. They were from America. Old Black Joe
was part of America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to them!&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed. The applause
came roaring back to them. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to die for
them, Jan. All you&rsquo;ve got to do is sing for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sing for them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sing for them forever!&rdquo; Jan sprang up.</p>
<p>This time she sang,&mdash;&ldquo;I Got Plenty of Nothin&rsquo;&rdquo;, and
as she sang she turned her pockets wrong side out, one by
one.</p>
<p>In the middle of the song with all her empty pockets
hanging out, she stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Has any of you all got a pipe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Sure! Oh, sure!&rdquo; came in a roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine! Has any of you all got a little &rsquo;bacca?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Sure!&rdquo; came again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s swell. Has any of you all got a match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roar came again, this time accompanied with a
shower of match boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You all keep &rsquo;em!&rdquo; Jan shouted. &ldquo;You all&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to need &rsquo;em&mdash;maybe tomorrow. Nobody don&rsquo;t never
know. But me,&rdquo; she sang, &ldquo;I got plenty of nothing, and
nothing is plenty for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That show was a huge success and it didn&rsquo;t take a
dramatic critic to tell that the Lady Barber Quartette had
been THE feature that evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>The Woman in Purple Burns a City</i></span></h2>
<p>It was a shame to sneak off after they had received such
a grand reception, but had they remained, they must
surely have been crushed by the mob of boys in khaki
eager to congratulate the girls from America. So, with the
lady of the hour at the wheel, they piled into the old jeep
and rode away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re such nice boys!&rdquo; Isabelle murmured. &ldquo;It seems
terrible that some of them may die horrible deaths tomorrow,
or the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not so many,&rdquo; Gale replied hopefully. &ldquo;Tonight
while we were waiting for things to start the colonel
told me how well things have been planned. He thinks
they&rsquo;ll just go sweeping across Burma into China. He says
this is a diversionary move. The main fight will be farther
south. The Japs don&rsquo;t expect this so they won&rsquo;t be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;He told you all that?&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, well,
nothing matters much. It won&rsquo;t be long now. And at that,
he didn&rsquo;t tell you a great deal. They have been at it for
months. In another forest quite a way from here, engines
with portable saw mills have been cutting timber for
bridges across the river that the colonel and his party
waded on their retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really marvelous. Every piece is cut just right. The
bridges are set up, then taken down again in the forest.
When the time comes the parts will be sent over chutes
built down the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve built hundreds of boats too, and they&rsquo;ll go
down the chutes. The whole army will be in Burma before
the Japs know they&rsquo;re coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s marvelous.&rdquo; Gale sighed. &ldquo;I wish the boys luck,
every one of them. One more thing I wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Isabelle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could hear from Jimmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That reminds me!&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed. &ldquo;A flight
commander was in to see the colonel today. The colonel
was out, so I had a chance to talk to him. I asked him
about Jimmie. He said he couldn&rsquo;t tell me a thing, then
smiled in a queer sort of way and said something about a
secret mission. It all sounded very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it does!&rdquo; Gale agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed. &ldquo;Did you report what we
saw at the temple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the woman in purple? Oh, sure I did! I told
the colonel about it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say,&rdquo; Gale asked anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed interested. He&rsquo;s seen the woman&mdash;met her
at some big dinner. It seems that in India she is still
quite a person. It&rsquo;s only in China and Burma that she&rsquo;s
in bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it is,&rdquo; Gale exclaimed. &ldquo;A woman in
a glorious gown can get around men. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder
if a lot of those English secret agents were really stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! They are!&rdquo; Than Shwe agreed. &ldquo;Some of them
are very, very stupid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to tell you,&rdquo; she added as an afterthought,
&ldquo;that Chinese nurse, Mai-da, is coming to visit us tonight.
Believe me, she will tell you about this Madam Stark, the
woman in purple, as you call her. She will tell you plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The colonel wasn&rsquo;t taken in by this woman.&rdquo; Isabelle
defended her boss. &ldquo;He just never has seen much of her&mdash;really
doesn&rsquo;t know much about her. He sent me over to
the Army Intelligence Headquarters to report on her. The
head man there was out. Nearly everyone is these days.
Big things just around the corner, you know. A very nice
boy with pink cheeks, blue eyes and a smile, wrote down
all I told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And said he&rsquo;d report on it,&rdquo; Gale exploded. &ldquo;Oh! Sure!
That&rsquo;s army life for you! My Dad said I&rsquo;d have to be a
good waiter. And if I get my head blown off by a bomb
while I wait, what then? I saw the tall thin man who is
lame in both legs again today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed. &ldquo;Way up here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. On the ridge only half a mile from our hideout.
What do you expect? He and that woman in purple are
anti-British spies, I tell you! And they&rsquo;re out to wreck
us&mdash;have been ever since I put my radar fingers on those
Jap planes up there in the clouds above the city and helped
bring them down. They&rsquo;ll get us if they can&mdash;yes&mdash;and
the Three Secrets of Radar as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment a small round face appeared at the
opening of the tent flap and a voice said: &ldquo;May I come
in?&rdquo; It was Mai-da, the Chinese nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in! Come right on!&rdquo; was their welcome.</p>
<p>Jan had been brewing tea. It was steeped now, so that
all sat on the floor sipping tea, munching gingersnaps and
talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been a long time away from your home,&rdquo;
Gale said to Mai-da.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! A very long time,&rdquo; Mai-da agreed. &ldquo;India
has been very kind to me but I shall be glad to get back
to my home. We ARE going back, you know.&rdquo; Mai-da&rsquo;s
voice rose. &ldquo;Everyone believes that. We have great faith
in your major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Gale looked at the Chinese girl with her small
hands and feet, her round, doll-like face and slender body,
she marvelled that she could stand up to the work of a
nurse. But Mai-da had endured more than she dreamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about your home, Mai-da,&rdquo; Isabelle said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is really very charming. At least I hope you
may say so when you see it.&rdquo; Mai-da half apologized. &ldquo;It
is at the foot of a hill where big, black pines seem to be
marching. It has a high stone wall about it. Ours is an
old, old family. Thirty generations have lived there. And
we all live together there now, seventy people of us,
but some have gone to war. Uncles, aunts, cousins, grandmothers,
great-grand-father&mdash;they are all there.&rdquo; She
laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we nearly lost our home.&rdquo; Her face sobered.
&ldquo;But perhaps you do not care for sad stories,&mdash;only those
that are good, beautiful and happy.&rdquo; Mai-da paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take life as we find it,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s slow reply. &ldquo;If
there is evil in the world, if bad men and women seem to
have their way, we want to know about it. But all the time
we try to kid ourselves into believing that &lsquo;God is in His
heavens&mdash;all&rsquo;s right with the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps we&rsquo;re not kidding ourselves so much after
all,&rdquo; she added softly. &ldquo;Tell us about the time you nearly
lost your home, Mai-da.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was truly terrible,&rdquo; Mai-da murmured softly.
&ldquo;Wicked woman came to live in a large house built by a
trader. It had been her husband&rsquo;s house. He was gone
now, so she claimed it. There was no one who could tell
her to go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather, he is old and very wise. He said:
&lsquo;If Madam Stark lives in that house evil days will come to
us&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam Stark,&rdquo; Isabelle murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;The woman in purple,&rdquo; Gale added. Mai-da continued
in her sing-song voice, so slow and musical. She had
learned English in a mission school and had traveled in
America. &ldquo;Grandfather was right. This woman hired
many strong men to guard her men who thought China
had no chance against the terrible Japs, men who said
&lsquo;It is better to give up and allow the Japs to rule us&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Japs came closer and closer to the beautiful little
city of May-da, close to our home. There was a temple on
the hill above our home. The Japs bombed it. Many
priests were killed, and they were oh, such good men,
those priests, always doing good, never harming anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mai-da sighed deeply, then went on. &ldquo;There was a
war lord living close to our city. He pretended to be loyal
to Chiang Kai-shek, but I don&rsquo;t think he ever was. Madam
Stark, in her purple gown of rich silk fascinated him. He
did what she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day she said: &lsquo;The Japs are very close to the city.
The city will be captured. It is better to burn the city than
to let the Japs have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the war lord told his men to burn the city,&rdquo; Than
Shwe murmured sadly. &ldquo;I have heard of this. It was very
terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city was burned.&rdquo; Mai-da&rsquo;s voice was low. &ldquo;Many
people lost their life. Others wandered homeless in the
fields. Our home is outside the city. We took in all the
people we could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;&mdash;her voice rose, &ldquo;my grandfather, who was old
but very brave, said, &lsquo;This terrible woman must be driven
out.&rsquo; He talked to all the people. They took all the guns
and knives they had and went after that woman and if she
had not gone away in a plane she would have been killed.
Her big house was burned. The people joined with the
soldiers. The Japs were driven back, and the poor burnt
city was never captured. My home still smiles from the
foot of the mountain. It waits for me.&mdash;Tomorrow or the
day after,&rdquo; the little Chinese nurse finished quite simply,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was the Woman in Purple,&rdquo; Gale said,
springing up. &ldquo;If the army doesn&rsquo;t get her then we must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will!&rdquo; Than Shwe exclaimed. &ldquo;By all the gods
of India, Burma, China and America, we will!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Gale! Gale!</i></span></h2>
<p>For some time after retiring that night Gale lay on her
army cot, eyes staring at the blank walls of her tent, fully
awake. Through her mind whirled delicate chimes, ladies,
long lines of marching soldiers and a city of many small
houses surrounded by a wall. Then the scene changed,
became more bright, but it shifted to her hillside. Bombers
came whirling over, bombs dropped. She trembled with
fright. And then she saw the black dwarf&mdash;or was it the
thin man a little lame in both feet? As her mind held the
picture the two figures appeared to merge into one. At
that she fell asleep.</p>
<p>She awoke early next morning, routed the sleepy Jan
from her cot, then headed for her hideout. That this might
prove a day of great importance she knew right well. If
the Japs had any way of guessing or knowing that soldiers
were camped in the shade of the Secret Forest, their planes
would come swarming over. And if she failed to detect
them? &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t fail!&rdquo; she declared to Jan as they climbed
through the dark just before dawn to their roost among the
rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you get that &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;You
know good and well that I&rsquo;m only your orderly, or&mdash;or
something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do your part, and do it well,&rdquo; Gale insisted. &ldquo;So
together we stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need any more
glory. You got your share last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I wow them!&rdquo; Jan laughed. &ldquo;I could do it all
over a hundred times and like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I keep thinking of those fine boys!&rdquo; she added
soberly. &ldquo;How many do you think will get to go back to
America after it&rsquo;s over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably most of them. The Japs can&rsquo;t do much to
a bunch like that. And Jan,&rdquo;&mdash;Gale&rsquo;s tone was thoughtful&mdash;&ldquo;Did
you ever stop to think that going to war isn&rsquo;t a
total loss?&rdquo; &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you dope that out?&rdquo; Jan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, look at those boys we tried to entertain
last night. What would they be doing if the war hadn&rsquo;t
come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to school, shining shoes, driving tractors, selling
shirts, making automobiles, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed. &ldquo;Most of them
wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten more than a hundred miles from
the old home town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, and they&rsquo;d have worked at the same old
thing all their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now look!&rdquo; Gale added eagerly. &ldquo;Nine out of
ten will get back home all okay, and what a lot they&rsquo;ll
have to talk about. India, Burma, China. They&rsquo;ll know a
lot too and maybe they&rsquo;ll help this poor old world with a
headache figure out some of its problems.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, maybe.&rdquo; Jan agreed grudgingly. &ldquo;But you
can&rsquo;t sell me no war. I got into this one because I thought
I was needed, and it was too big a thing to stay out of.
But once it&rsquo;s over, watch me get a job driving a pie wagon,
or just anything.&rdquo; Jan laughed merrily.</p>
<p>And so here they were at their station. And a busy
station it was to be on that particular day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan, when do you think the big push into Burma will
come?&rdquo; Gale asked, a bit out of breath as they reached
their roost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very soon!&rdquo; was the prompt reply. &ldquo;As your Jimmie
would say, &lsquo;there are signs&rsquo;. Perhaps it will be tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better look out,&rdquo; Gale replied solemnly.</p>
<p>They did look out every fifteen minutes throughout the
forenoon. Gale&rsquo;s radar fingers felt their way through the
sky. There was a haze along the horizon. Those feeling
fingers reached much farther than eyes could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All quiet,&rdquo; Gale said as the noon hour came. &ldquo;Fifteen
minutes out for lunch. It&rsquo;s bright outside. Let&rsquo;s go out and
sit on a rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lunch was soon over. They ate little at noon. Then
they spread themselves out on a narrow rock and gazed up
at the cloudless sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing up there,&rdquo; Jan murmured. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem like
there ever could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come where my love lies dreaming the happy hours
away,&rdquo; she sang softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fool yourself.&rdquo; Gale sat up, picking at the grass
that grew by the edge of the rock. &ldquo;This is war. War is
never like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if she had heard a phone ring,&mdash;which she
had not&mdash;she sprang to her feet and hurried to her station.</p>
<p>Her radar set had not been humming more than a
minute when she called excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan! Come quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; Jan bounded into the lookout. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty! Off a hundred miles due east the sky is filled
with planes. Looks like a raid. Get headquarters at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; Jan announced twenty seconds later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headquarters?&rdquo; Gale tried to keep her excitement out
of her voice. &ldquo;This is G. G. J. Looks like a raid. Many
planes two hundred miles straight out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Report again in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later Gale&rsquo;s report was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;G. G. J., Refer to last report. No change except approaching
at two hundred miles per hour. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all for Gale, at least for the time being. But
for the pilots, radio men and gunners of two hundred of
America&rsquo;s finest fighter planes, it was but the beginning
of something big, and for some, disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know we&rsquo;re here and now they&rsquo;re after us,&rdquo;
Danny Dean, the pilot of a two-seater said to his gunner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them come,&rdquo; was the prompt answer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re as
ready as we&rsquo;ll ever be. The more we knock down here the
less we&rsquo;ll have to fight when the big business starts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Not a pilot left the Secret Forest that day but caught
his breath as he saw the eastern sky blackened by Jap
planes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s tipped them off,&rdquo; one bright-eyed boy
shouted. &ldquo;But let them come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In half an hour the sky was filled with planes. American
fighters ganged up like catbirds after crows, to down Jap
bombers before they reached their objective. Nor were
the fighter planes all the trouble those Jap planes met that
day. Together with twenty other gunners, Gale&rsquo;s friend
Mac was stationed on a rocky ledge outside the forest. A
lucky shot at the very start brought a bomber down so close
to him that he was obliged to bury himself in a bush to
escape its flying parts. Even Isabelle&rsquo;s Pete had driven his
tank to the edge of the forest and was having a go at them
with a machine gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful scrap,&rdquo; Jan was all but sobbing with
terror and delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful and terrible,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s solemn reply. &ldquo;I
saw one of our planes go down and the pilot didn&rsquo;t bail
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the main Gale had eyes for but one plane, a small
one with long, slender wings, Jimmie&rsquo;s plane. After studying
the sky for ten minutes she decided he was not there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jimmie!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; Then
with a start she recalled a promise she had made to him.
&ldquo;If I disappear,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;And you suspect that something
has happened to me, listen in at your radio every
night at ten.&rdquo; He had written down the wave length and
given it to her. &ldquo;If I have any sort of a radio,&rdquo; he had
added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on the air. I might even talk from the other
world.&rdquo; He gave a strange laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised,&rdquo; she told herself now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll listen tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air battle was brief, fierce and decisive. A few of
the enemy bombers got through to drop their bombs on the
Secret Forest. There were some casualties&mdash;not many.
Most of the bombers were driven off or destroyed. Once
more the boys of the U. S. Air Force had won a signal
victory and not a little of the credit was due to &ldquo;Radar
Gale&rdquo; as the young WAC with the flying hair was often
called.</p>
<p>At the very end of this battle something startling and
terrible happened. Gale and Jan were in their hideout.
Gale was feeling about in the sky with her radar for possible
Jap attackers when Jan exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Gale! That Jap plane is coming straight at us
and no one is after it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plane, a rather large Zero with a powerful motor
was headed straight for them. Only a few moments before
Gale had seen just such a plane drop a bomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Get into the cellar! He&rsquo;s got us
spotted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They tumbled rather than climbed down the rocky stairs
and had half way slid the steel door to their bomb shelter
shut when an explosion all but over their heads seemed to
tear the very side of the mountain away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Jan reeled backward but stayed on her feet. Gale
crumpled down, hit her head on the rock floor, rolled over
and lay still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! My God!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;She must be dead!
It&rsquo;s the concussion! What shall I do?&rdquo; Greatly excited she
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale! Gale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gale neither moved nor answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Gale Gets Her Plane</i></span></h2>
<p>Jan was frantic. In the air raid shelter, gas from the explosion
was stifling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get Gale out of here,&rdquo;
she told herself. She tried to move the steel door. It was
jammed,&mdash;would not move&mdash;but was still half open. She
was able to crowd her ample body through the opening.
Outside she worked frantically removing rocks that shut
away the outside air. After that she dragged the unconscious
form of her companion from the cellar and up over
tumbled rocks to a place in the sunshine above.</p>
<p>All the time she was listening, watching. The plane
might return. The roar of motors, the rat-tat-tat of machine-gun
fire now seemed far away. But who could tell
what a moment might bring?</p>
<p>With her companion lying on a sunny rock, Jan rushed
back to the cellar for a gallon thermos bottle filled with
cold water.</p>
<p>Back at Gale&rsquo;s side, in her excitement she poured the
entire contents of the bottle on Gale&rsquo;s face. Some of it
went into Gale&rsquo;s mouth. Suddenly she sat up, coughing
and spouting water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Thank God you&rsquo;re not dead!&rdquo; Jan was fairly
beside herself with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of&mdash;of course not,&rdquo; Gale sputtered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, you passed out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what happened?&rdquo; Gale asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a direct hit,&rdquo;&mdash;Jan glanced about. &ldquo;If it had
been it would have blown us to glory. It blew the top of
our hideout and your radar set down to the rocks below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we have to get that radar set. Remember. Three
Secrets of Radar!&rdquo; Gale was feeling better. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; Jan studied the sky. &ldquo;The fighting is far
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One plane is coming. I hear it,&rdquo; Gale insisted.</p>
<p>There came the sound of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Gale opened her eyes, then wiped the
water from her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our Chinese guard. They weren&rsquo;t killed. That&rsquo;s
swell!&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>Two youthful Chinese soldiers appeared round a ledge,
dragging a heavy machine-gun after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; said the taller of the pair. &ldquo;Wanna shoot
this plane. Can&rsquo;t shoot airplane&mdash;too fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that gun.&rdquo; Gale staggered to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made in America,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Good old America!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With skilled hands she set the gun up behind a pile
of rocks. Then she examined each part with care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gun,&rdquo; she told Jan. &ldquo;My father is an expert on
machine-guns. He showed me all about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you shoot them?&rdquo; Jan asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; Gale laughed hoarsely. There was still some
water in her throat. &ldquo;Father had a range set up. We
practiced together. I used to beat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you did,&rdquo; Jan replied admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Gale held up a hand. &ldquo;That plane is coming
back. Wants to see if he got us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he got one more&mdash;&rsquo;nother bomb.&rdquo; The tall
Chinese soldier turned green as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they have,&rdquo; Gale agreed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go
hide again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wantee me, I stayee.&rdquo; The Chinese boy was
game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You go. I&rsquo;ll shoot that plane.&rdquo; Gale ran her eye
over the barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shoot him?&rdquo; The Chinaman stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Why not?&rdquo; Gale adjusted the sight. &ldquo;You scram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In ten seconds the guards had lost themselves among
the rocks.</p>
<p>Gale and Jan were now lying flat on the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan,&rdquo;&mdash;Gale&rsquo;s voice was husky. &ldquo;You crawl back down
into that cellar. Crawl. Don&rsquo;t walk. That way he can&rsquo;t
see you. Let him think we&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what will you do?&rdquo; Jan breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lie right here and when the time comes I&rsquo;ll bend my
finger, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s slow reply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that
Jap, not a bit. Think of coming back to gloat over what
you&rsquo;ve done to a couple of girls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know we were girls,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no? Well, perhaps he did. They know too much,
those little brown men, or think they do. Well, here comes
one that may not know a thing after today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you slide out of here, and slide fast!&rdquo; Gale commanded.
And Jan slid.</p>
<p>The Jap plane had been coming in low. That was so
any American planes above wouldn&rsquo;t see it. Perhaps the
pilot had been ordered back to observe and report. Gale
wouldn&rsquo;t know about that,&mdash;not for sure. As the Chinese
soldier had said, he might be bringing in one more bomb
to finish the job. One thing was sure. He did have a
machine-gun. That was dangerous.</p>
<p>Gale&rsquo;s suit was the color of the rocks. But her face?
She tore a hole in her khaki handkerchief, then tied it
on as a mask.</p>
<p>The plane was coming up now. &ldquo;Report to Tojo, will
you?&rdquo; she hissed. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll report to that other big
man who was killed in an airplane months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her finger was crooked around the trigger, her gun
aimed. She might have to change the aim a bit,&mdash;not much
though. These little brown men had one-track minds. She
had seen the course he took before. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t change,&rdquo;
she told herself.</p>
<p>Gale was right. He did not change, but she did. A
sudden dizziness took possession of her. Was it the fumes
she had been breathing, or the knock on her head when
she fell? The reason did not matter. All that mattered now
was that everything went dim before her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Like Samson, she prayed,&mdash;&ldquo;God, give me my sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if by a miracle, her sight was restored.</p>
<p>And now, here was the plane. It was close, very close.
Three seconds now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three,&rdquo; she counted. Then her gun spoke in
a long, rasping chatter. She didn&rsquo;t want to look but she
had to. Perhaps she had missed. Perhaps he did carry a
bomb.</p>
<p>She saw the look of pained surprise on the pilot&rsquo;s face.
His engine was half shot away. She changed her aim a
little and fired another volley. After that she did not look.
It wasn&rsquo;t necessary. Half a minute later the sound of an
explosion came up from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;He did have another bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up. She was trembling like a leaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale! You are a mess!&rdquo; said a voice from behind her.
&ldquo;Your face is black and your hair is flying wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; Gale laughed hoarsely. &ldquo;The soldiers
have a song they sing. I don&rsquo;t like it, but it fits just now:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes the wild WACS wild, Bill? What makes
the wild WACS wild?&rdquo; she sang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re wild because they&rsquo;re wild, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re wild because they&rsquo;re wild,&rdquo; Jan chimed in,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re wild because they&rsquo;re wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Gale exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s boss here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, of course.&rdquo; Jan&rsquo;s chin dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you go down in that cellar as I commanded
you to?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Jan. &ldquo;What did you do when your father
was a sheriff and got into a fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I climbed onto a chair, of course. He was my daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You&rsquo;re MY pal. You might have passed out
again. Then I&rsquo;d have had to drag you into the cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nearly did,&rdquo; Gale confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, there you are!&rdquo; Jan laughed softly. &ldquo;Besides,
I wanted to see you shoot that plane down,&rdquo; Jan
admitted. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d do it. You&rsquo;re just wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jan darling!&rdquo; Gale threw an arm over the big
girl&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real pal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had some artist seen them then, their clothes torn and
disarranged, their faces black and hair flying, two WACS
facing the sun on a ridge down which all their equipment
and a Jap bomber had gone, he might have painted their
picture and immortalized them forever.</p>
<p>As it was, Gale heaved a deep sigh, then said in a
matter-of-fact voice, &ldquo;Jan, we&rsquo;ve just got to rescue my
radar set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s smashed to bits,&rdquo; Jan sighed wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be. And if it is, the parts are all there.&rdquo;
Gale&rsquo;s tone was insistent. &ldquo;And think what it would mean
if some dirty enemy spy got it! Come on! Let&rsquo;s see if we can
get down there.&rdquo; So down they started.</p>
<p>And as they went Gale told herself,&mdash;&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t forget
to listen on the radio tonight at ten for Jimmie. He said
he might talk from another world.&rdquo; He did, almost, at
that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Two Shots and a Surprise</i></span></h2>
<p>Gale and Jan climbed down the rocky cliff over which
the radar set had been blown by the enemy&rsquo;s bomb until
it seemed they could go no farther. They at last found
themselves on a narrow rocky ledge that overlooked a perpendicular
wall of rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a grip on my leg,&rdquo; Jan said. &ldquo;Just in case I get
dizzy. I&rsquo;ll lay down flat and look over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo; Gripping Jan&rsquo;s right ankle with both
her hands, Gale sat down and braced herself with her
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Here I go,&rdquo; Jan grunted. Flat on her stomach,
she crept out a foot&mdash;two feet&mdash;until her head and
shoulders hung over thin air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan! That&rsquo;s far enough!&rdquo; Gale cried in consternation.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be killed! Let the old radar set go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I see it,&rdquo; Jan panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout forty feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Gale tried to be cheerful about it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take
it at a running jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I see something else,&rdquo; Jan puffed. &ldquo;That wire cable
that brought us our electricity is caught on this ledge we&rsquo;re
on, only farther over. If we could only get hold of that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;We could fasten it some way and I could shinny down
it!&rdquo; In the excitement Gale barely missed letting go of
Jan&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al&mdash;all right. We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll try. Pull me back,&rdquo; Jan
ordered.</p>
<p>It was only by a feat of acrobatics, plus expert mountain
climbing in which Gale narrowly escaped tumbling into
the abyss below that they at last reached the tangled mass
of wire.</p>
<p>After testing the wire and finding it devoid of electric
current, they untangled it far enough to give Gale support
on her way down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a good secure hold.&rdquo; Gale looked about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the very thing!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;A regular
thumb of rock reaching up from the ledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After making their way a little farther along the ledge,
they found a three-foot column of rock jutting up from
the main ledge and really a part of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;An elephant couldn&rsquo;t
tear that loose. Even I could go down!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Why
not let me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll go. I want to make sure that I have all the
secret parts when you pull it up. Well,&rdquo; Gale sighed,
&ldquo;Here I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bracing her feet against the side of the rocky wall and
at the same time gripping the cable with both hands, she
went hand-over-hand and foot-over-foot down the perpendicular
wall until with a low grunt she hit bottom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>After shouting &ldquo;Yoo-hoo! Okay!&rdquo; she started her search
for the spot where the radar set had landed.</p>
<p>This was a wide ledge. On it grew many scrub pines
that, gnarled and twisted, seemed a company of grotesque
gnomes watching her at her task.</p>
<p>As she passed these Gale imagined she heard a sound
like the scraping of a heavy shoe on a rock.</p>
<p>Stepping short she thrust her hand into her jacket
pocket to grip the handle of a small blue automatic.</p>
<p>Jimmie had given her this dangerous plaything. &ldquo;A
girl with hair like yours, wild and unruly, needs a real
gun,&rdquo; he had said with a laugh. &ldquo;I got it off of a dead
Jap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was made in America,&rdquo; she had exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one of those nice little things we did for the Japs
before the war.&rdquo; His laugh was pleasant to hear. &ldquo;We sold
them, of course. Someone made money on that deal. Now
the Japs use the guns to kill us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not this one,&rdquo; she had said, thrusting the gun into
her pocket.</p>
<p>She was in a lonely spot at this moment, perhaps too
in a tight place. The cold steel in her hand felt good.</p>
<p>For three tense moments she stood there, poised like a
tiger for a sudden spring. It was hot down there. A breeze
set the gnome-like pines whispering. Other than this,
there was no sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably imagined that,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Nobody
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>At that instant Jan called: &ldquo;Gale! Are you there? Did
you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Gale called back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it in a jiffy.&rdquo; She
wasn&rsquo;t going to get Jan excited about nothing.</p>
<p>A few moments later she came upon a tumbled pile of
rocks, broken glass and wood that had but an hour before
been her hideout.</p>
<p>Half hidden in this pile, was her precious radar set.
It had been badly torn and crushed. For all that, it somehow
managed to hang together while she dragged it
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand prize for our enemies,&rdquo; she grunted softly. Then
with a start she straightened up. Again from behind a row
of twisted pines there had come a sound. &ldquo;Might be a
tiger,&rdquo; she thought with a shudder. That there were tigers
in these mountains she knew well enough. &ldquo;Or head-hunters,
or even enemy spies,&rdquo; she went on thinking.
Which did she fear most? She could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get up out of here,&rdquo; she told herself. Then she
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan! Jan! Here I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; Jan called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan. Draw the cable up. Bring it over this way. Then
let it down again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Gale could hear Jan moving along the ledge
above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Keeping her eyes on the dwarf pines as much as possible,
Gale dragged a tangled mass of electric wire from
the mass of rocks. After untangling this, she wound it
round and round the radar set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Now I can attach it to the
cable and Jan can draw it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it comes,&rdquo; Jan called a moment later as the
twisted cable came gliding down the rocky wall.</p>
<p>In a twinkle Gale had the cable attached to the radar
set and was watching it go up.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at that moment she was seized with
a sense of wild panic. It was only by exerting all her will
power that she avoided ordering Jan to let the radar set
down so she could go up instead. Little wonder, for she
had been through much that day.</p>
<p>And then she heard it again,&mdash;that strange scraping on
rock that was like shuffling footsteps, but not quite. Instantly
her eyes were on the dwarf pines. Did she get a
fleeting glimpse of a face and gleaming eyes? She could
not be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case of doubt, act!&rdquo; had been her father&rsquo;s motto.
She acted now. Aiming low, she fired two shots. Bang!
Bang! To her startled ears, the shots echoing in the cavern
seemed like cannon fire.</p>
<p>There followed a sound of commotion behind the pines.
Then all was silence.</p>
<p>Out of that silence came Jan&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale! Who fired those shots? Gale! Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Gale made no reply. Instead, pistol in hand, she strode
across the rocks toward the pines. Arrived there, she
parted the branches to find herself staring into a wide
empty space beyond.</p>
<p>She stood there staring in surprise. No living creature
was there.</p>
<p>Her eyes swept the place in all directions. Then she
looked down. There, almost at her feet, was a thing
covered with leather. It was like a shoe. There was a strap
attached to it. The strap had been cut by a bullet.</p>
<p>With a low cry she picked the thing up and thrust it
deep into the pocket of her coat. Then stepping back over
the rocks, she called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan! Lower the cable. I&rsquo;m ready to come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cable coming down,&rdquo; was the instant reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>This Is the Zero Hour</i></span></h2>
<p>That night Gale kept her resolve to listen in on Jimmie&rsquo;s
wave-length at ten, and with startling results.</p>
<p>Half an hour later an orderly from headquarters was
at the door of her tent to say that the colonel wanted to
see her at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a night!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;This is one night
when I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if all the stars were to fall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she at last stood before the colonel with a smart
salute, her usual composure came back to her, for the
colonel at once put her at her ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you had a little trouble today,&rdquo; he said
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lost our station,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bombed out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But not until we had done our work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; The colonel gave her a rare smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recovered our radar set,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; He showed some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was blown into a gully by the bomb. Getting
down wasn&rsquo;t easy. But we had it to do. There are secrets
to radar, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three main secrets. We call those the Three Secrets
of Radar. I&rsquo;m sure that enemy spies are after them&mdash;a
woman in purple and a black dwarf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabelle told me about these, and that you have seen
the woman in a temple near here. It is not easy to keep
track of all the people around us. I sent two Intelligence
Officers to investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Gale leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They got on the woman&rsquo;s trail and followed it
for hours. They lost it at last in a terrible stretch of jungle
the flyers call &lsquo;Hell&rsquo;s Half Hour&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Half Hour!&rdquo; the girl breathed, in sudden surprise.
&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; she caught herself and did not finish. Instead,
she said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the Black Dwarf is not with that
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shot at something when I was recovering my radar.&rdquo;
She reached deep in her pocket. &ldquo;Someone was watching
me. He was after my radar. He got a shot instead. My
bullet cut the strap&mdash;from this.&rdquo; She drew something
strange from her pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s made of aluminum, covered with thin leather,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about six inches high and fits the right
foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shoe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Only an extension to a shoe. A pair of them would
made a dwarf look like a tall, thin man,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve seen such a man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three times.&rdquo; Gale told of her adventures with the
tall, thin man in the temple back at the city, and of the
other times she had seen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if the Woman in Purple and the Black Dwarf
who is sometimes a tall, thin man, were on your trail. But
that,&rdquo; the colonel straightened up in his chair, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
not why I sent for you. Tonight,&rdquo;&mdash;he leaned forward to
speak in a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;Tonight at one A.M. is the Zero-hour.
The big push starts then.&rdquo; His eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>For a full moment Gale stared at him in awed silence.
Then, speaking with an effort, she said: &ldquo;I&mdash;I wish you
luck.&rdquo; She put out a hand. He gripped it hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means a lot to me.&rdquo; His voice was almost solemn.
&ldquo;That other time we did our best, but always we had too
little, too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got everything&mdash;tanks, guns, men, airplanes&mdash;everything.
We&rsquo;ll beat the tar out of them. I
wondered,&rdquo;&mdash;again he leaned forward, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d like to
go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale stared, but said never a word. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been hard
to arrange.&rdquo; His voice rumbled. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got it all fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;,&rdquo; her throat was dry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was his turn to stare. &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;not yet.
You see,&rdquo; she went on, leaning across the desk, &ldquo;Jimmie
and his plane are down off there on Hell&rsquo;s Half Hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie Nightingale.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He half rose from his chair. &ldquo;He was on a very
secret mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mission is safe enough. It was on his way back
that they got him. Someone must have tipped the Japs
off. Two planes took him by surprise. He got away in
his parachute, but hung up in a tall tree, then fell. One
leg is injured. He can only drag himself along. He
got to his wrecked plane and is living on emergency
rations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could you know all this?&rdquo; He stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had an agreement about listening at ten. I listened
tonight. He had his radio going&mdash;the speaking end. The
listening part is wrecked. The Woman in Purple is up
there somewhere. Jimmie is helpless. That&rsquo;s where I want
to go!&rdquo; Her words came out like a cry in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d give up the big push for Jimmie?&rdquo; There was
a strange light in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and so would you,&rdquo; was the quick reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, I would. Jimmie is one of my boys, one
of my best. I can&rsquo;t go. The big push is on. You go. I&rsquo;ll give
you Jan and her jeep for transportation. Jan will drive
that jeep of hers through hell and high water. You go, and
God guide you.&rdquo; He stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but I want to join you later,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure! Soon as you can,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in
China again. I&rsquo;ll team you and Mac up again to guard my
headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. We&rsquo;ll guard it well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Just then an orderly announced the arrival of Than
Shwe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than Shwe, my child,&rdquo; said the colonel as the little
nurse stood in the doorway. &ldquo;We march tonight. You will
report here in two hours with about four times as much
baggage as you carried on our retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my colonel!&rdquo; Than Shwe rushed to the old colonel
and threw her arms about his neck. &ldquo;I knew you
would not leave me behind when the big push came!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said the colonel, after engineering his
escape from the girl&rsquo;s embrace. &ldquo;I would leave anyone else
behind first. We went through hell and high water together.&rdquo;
He laughed a joyous roaring laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We waded the river for hours.&rdquo; Than Shwe was laughing
too. &ldquo;The younger men they were too hot, too tired.
They were about to drop. But you, you who are sixty, you
were magnificent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You marched along with your Tommy-gun on your
shoulder and you said, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with these
young men? When I was young, if I couldn&rsquo;t do this before
breakfast I&rsquo;d have been ashamed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Than Shwe!&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;You and
all the native nurses were magnificent. You held your
dresses high and splashed the water&mdash;you danced and sang
crazy songs while all the time you knew that bombs from a
Jap plane or machine-gun fire from shore might at any
moment send all to Kingdom Come. Yes! Yes! Than Shwe,
you are going, you and Isabelle will ride in my car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Gale?&rdquo; The little nurse was loyal to all her
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale is to go on another mission. One of her own choosing,&rdquo;
was the quiet reply. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;scram,
you girls. I&rsquo;ve got to give twenty thousand boys their
final marching orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like that,&rdquo; Gale whispered to Than Shwe. &ldquo;Was
there ever such a colonel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; was the quick reply. &ldquo;This is his great
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Perhaps the greatest of his life. And yet he has
time for us.&rdquo; Gale was happy and proud. Then she thought
of Jimmie, lost out there in the wilds, injured and alone.
Her step quickened. &ldquo;Nothing can hold me back,&rdquo; she
whispered, &ldquo;just nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Red-Heads Always Come Back</i></span></h2>
<p>Though Jimmie had given Gale the name of the river that
flowed out of the narrow valley where his plane had been
wrecked and had even told her that he was on the right
bank of that river, she experienced the greatest difficulty
in securing the directions necessary to speed her on her
way.</p>
<p>At last she came upon an English captain who could
direct her. &ldquo;Oh! No, my dear!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It would
be entirely impossible for you to drive a jeep up the way
this terrible woman you have spoken of has gone. You
must follow the colonel&rsquo;s road back to this point.&rdquo; He
placed his pencil on the map. &ldquo;Then you must follow this
river over a road that is not a road really, only a camel&rsquo;s
track. But I daresay you&rsquo;ll make it for some distance in a
jeep. Those things are more or less of a camel breed.&rdquo; He
laughed heartily. &ldquo;In the end, however, you&rsquo;ll be obliged
to walk a long, long way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walkin&rsquo;s the best thing we do,&rdquo; Jan declared stoutly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my! Yes! I daresay,&rdquo; the captain agreed. &ldquo;And by
the way, it&rsquo;s jolly good I thought of this. There&rsquo;s a Buddhist
temple up that river, rather a long way up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Another temple!&rdquo; Gale sighed. &ldquo;Temples have
brought us only bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; the captain exclaimed. &ldquo;Well now,
perhaps your luck will change. I&rsquo;ve heard some good things
about this particular temple&mdash;a good little man at the head
of it, and all that. But then, one never knows. Well,
cheerio! I&rsquo;ll be going. I was with the colonel on his retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Were you?&rdquo; Gale exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, rather. So I must be in on his triumph, if there
is to be a triumph. Well, rather!&rdquo; He laughed as he
vanished into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never believe us when we tell them at home
about the things that have happened to us,&rdquo; Gale laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Nor the kind of people we met. I&rsquo;ll say they
won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;you say we stuff our
duffle bags, turn the old jeep over, and ramble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later they rambled into the night.</p>
<p>At first they met many trucks and cars feeling their
way over the road with dimmed lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming to join the big push.&rdquo; Jan&rsquo;s voice was husky.
&ldquo;And here we are, going the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s slow reply. &ldquo;It breaks my heart.
It&rsquo;s the biggest thing we&rsquo;ll ever know, and we&rsquo;re stepping
out of it. But you can&rsquo;t desert a pal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to?&rdquo; Jan demanded. &ldquo;Somebody had to
make this trip. That Jimmie of yours was right up here
fighting before his country was in the war at all. Somebody
had to go. They couldn&rsquo;t spare fighting men&mdash;not just now
they couldn&rsquo;t. So they sent us. It&rsquo;s always a woman&rsquo;s job
to fill in when there&rsquo;s not enough men to go &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Gale agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of you to step into
it all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came at last to the spot where they must leave the
Colonel&rsquo;s fine road and turn up a camel trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed, as her jeep took a steep ridge
between trees so close together that they brushed them.
&ldquo;This is going to be something!&rdquo; And it was.</p>
<p>At times the sturdy little jeep, working on all four
wheels, stood straight up on end and pawed the air like a
bucking bronco, then leapt forward into space to land on
all fours and plunge forward again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I was raised on a ranch!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed
once. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been I&rsquo;d never be able to
wrangle this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time came at last when it seemed they could go
no farther and they were still a good twenty miles from
the spot on the map at which the English captain had said,
&ldquo;Here you must leave your jeep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not been up this trail lately,&rdquo; was Jan&rsquo;s sad comment.
The winter rains had washed the trail away leaving
a perpendicular bank of earth up which no jeep, however
stout, could hope to travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out and think,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think, and drink coffee,&rdquo; Jan amended. &ldquo;Coffee always
helps.&rdquo; There was a jug of hot coffee in the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, coffee helps,&rdquo; Gale agreed. &ldquo;But it will never
help enough this time, Jeep,&rdquo; she patted their iron steed
with real affection, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve done nobly, but here you
stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did some hopeful gremlin whisper, &ldquo;Little you know
about that!&rdquo;? If he did, Gale was too busy uncorking the
coffee jug to hear him.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the meantime, travelling before the oncoming army,
Isabelle and Than Shwe rode with the colonel in the back
seat of his big car. Driver and orderly rode in front while
three guards rode the sides.</p>
<p>Isabelle told herself that out of all her experiences this
one might prove to be the most thrilling. They drove in
absolute darkness. There was no moon. Great overhanging
trees hid the stars. The road wound in and out along the
mountain slope. There must be a place here and there
where they hung at the brink of an abyss. She dared not
think of that. Instead, she thought of Jimmie lost in the
wilds, and of her good pals going to his rescue. She thought
too of her home, thought how the trees cast shadows on the
green lawn, and how her father and mother would be
sitting at the breakfast table, perhaps talking about her.
She wished they could see her now. Of course she knew
that time was different on that side of the world. Perhaps
it was noon now, or sunset. This did not disturb her at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>Than Shwe was thinking how she had trudged up this
road, then only a rugged trail, barefoot, and was hoping
many things. The colonel thought of victories won and of
men lost. And so they rode on in silence through the night.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>As Gale and Jan sat beside the trail that had come to
an abrupt end, they became conscious of a stirring in the
brush. A dusky brown figure appeared in the spot of light
made by their car&rsquo;s lamps. Another appeared, another, and
yet another. Short, stout appearing natives, they were half
naked, and did not seem afraid. Many were lurking in the
shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like gnomes of the forest,&rdquo; Jan whispered.</p>
<p>Gale made no reply. Truth is, she was frightened.</p>
<p>But Jan! &ldquo;Hi folks!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Want a good hot drink?
It&rsquo;s coffee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A solemn old man edged closer. Gale watched, fascinated.
Jan offered him her cup. He took it, sniffed it, then
drank it down.</p>
<p>Instantly the natives swarmed about them. Almost as
quickly the hot coffee they had hoped would last through
the night and the next day was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well be sociable!&rdquo; Jan laughed merrily, and
the natives laughed with her. Then they did an astonishing
thing. After cutting two stout poles, they ran them
through beneath Jan&rsquo;s tired jeep. Then at a grunt from
their leader, they picked up the poles, jeep and all, and
solemnly marched away. Like chief mourners, Jan and
Gale marched behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>It was quite a long march. The jeep could not have
made it alone. There were huge rocks in some places, and
narrow stretches in others, but somehow the clever savages
made it, and in due time the jeep, quite unharmed, was
deposited on the trail above the mud bank. At that the
natives disappeared into the bush from which they had
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Jan, &ldquo;was mighty stout coffee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; Gale agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, let&rsquo;s ramble!&rdquo; Gale took her place at the
wheel and again they rambled on into the night.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the meantime the colonel&rsquo;s car had reached the end
of the road. Beyond lay the river. Here, under a rocky
bank into which an air raid shelter had been cut, he set
up temporary headquarters in a tent. This done, with
orderly and guard at his heels, he strode away to make
some final arrangements for the big push.</p>
<p>Left to themselves, Isabelle and Than Shwe felt their
way over a hard-beaten trail to the spot where the road
appeared to end at the brink of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really end,&rdquo; said Isabelle in great surprise.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part of a bridge.&rdquo; The little native nurse had sharp
eyes.</p>
<p>Soon Isabelle realized that army engineers, working
swiftly and silently in the night, were throwing a bridge
across the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are other bridges going up,&rdquo; said a voice at her
elbow. It was the colonel. &ldquo;Our road winds back and
forth across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that river&mdash;you and I,&rdquo; Than Shwe laughed
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boats will be coming down the hill soon, hundreds
and hundreds of them. But just now, you and I,&rdquo;&mdash;he
touched Isabelle&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;must get out some orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that time till dawn, under a pale light in a dark
corner of the air raid shelter, Isabelle&rsquo;s portable type-writer
clicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There. That will do,&rdquo; the colonel sighed at last. &ldquo;The
big parade should arrive at any minute now. You girls
might like to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes!&rdquo; Than Shwe exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be worth seeing,&rdquo; the colonel rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will,&rdquo; Isabelle agreed. And it was.</p>
<p>The first faint flush of dawn gave them a shadowy view
of the grand parade&rsquo;s vanguard, a General Sherman tank.
Astride this tank rose a long figure. Strange as it may
seem, Isabelle recognized the figure instantly. She had
seen it outlined against the sunset on some football bench
too often to miss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete!&rdquo; she screamed above the rattle of the tank. &ldquo;Hi
there, Pete!&rdquo; She struggled hard to keep the tears from her
voice. It&rsquo;s bad enough when you tell your little man goodbye
at the depot, but to see him riding at the head of the
procession, going to battle on a tank, that was almost too
much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s dominant desire at the moment was to give
the big redhead something to remember her by. She racked
her brain for a moment. Then she had it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A red, red rose!&rdquo; she whispered, snatching at her
breast.</p>
<p>The colonel was fond of roses. He had brought a large
potted rose, in full bloom, to the Secret Forest. Intending
to leave this behind, he had cut two of the roses and given
them to Isabelle and Than Shwe.</p>
<p>Now, as Isabelle plucked hers from her jacket where it
was pinned, she raced along beside Pete&rsquo;s tank screaming
&ldquo;Pete! Pete! Here&rsquo;s something to take into battle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Oh! There you are! Great stuff!&rdquo; Pete leaned
far over to grasp the hand that held the rose. Then relinquishing
the hand, he grasped the rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it into battle,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;It will bring me
luck. You&rsquo;ll be proud of me, Isabelle, you really will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tank rumbled on, and Isabelle turned aside to
brush her eyes, then to exclaim to Than Shwe, &ldquo;War is
just what Sherman said it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Sherman say?&rdquo; Than Shwe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it was hot stuff,&rdquo; Isabelle laughed through her
tears. &ldquo;Redheads always come back,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>And so Pete rode away to war, astride his tank, Red
Dynamite, with the stem of a red rose between his teeth.
And the battle that day was to be real enough. Red
Dynamite was to have its turret blown clean off and Pete&mdash;well,
the fortunes of war are often strange.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>What the Drums Told</i></span></h2>
<p>The road that led to Hell&rsquo;s Half Hour grew more difficult
by the hour. More than once Jan climbed out to push
while Gale held the wheel. &ldquo;Get along there, Jeep,&rdquo; she
would cry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a strong back and a weak mind, but
we&rsquo;ve just got to get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When at last they reached the place marked &ldquo;Impassable&rdquo;
on the map, they realized that the map told the
truth. They were facing a stone wall up which only a
human being or a donkey could climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old Jeep,&rdquo; Jan patted her car affectionately,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve done nobly. We&rsquo;ll have to leave you here, but we&rsquo;ll
be back. At least we think we will,&rdquo; she added in a sober
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take the grub-sack,&rdquo; she said to Gale. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring
the stretcher we brought for Jimmie, and the blankets.&rdquo;
Again her strong back was to stand her in good stead.</p>
<p>To their surprise, once they had crossed the rocky
ridge, they found themselves on a well-travelled trail.
Here, however, the trees stood close together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we should have taken this foot-trail from the
start,&rdquo; said Gale. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shorter. If the Woman in Purple
headed this way, as the colonel said, she must have taken
this trail. Perhaps she&rsquo;s waiting for us somewhere in the
shadows.&rdquo; She shuddered. Darkness still hung over the
mountainside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her wait,&rdquo; was Jan&rsquo;s grim reply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix her
plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dawn that took Pete to battle with Isabelle&rsquo;s red
rose in his teeth found Gale and Jan trudging, weary and
more than half asleep, over a trail that had hourly grown
broader and hard-packed by the tread of many feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting somewhere,&rdquo; Jan paused for a moment
to down her load. &ldquo;But where? That&rsquo;s the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one more temple and more trouble,&rdquo; Gale sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t be sure.&rdquo; Jan was hopeful. &ldquo;This is our
third temple. Third time&rsquo;s the charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo; Gale once again took the trail.</p>
<p>A temple it was, and the most gorgeous one they had
ever seen. Its towers appeared to rival the giants of the
forest. It was surrounded by a high wall, and along the top
of the wall tigers, dragons and all manner of strange beasts,
all carved from hard wood and stone, appeared to race.</p>
<p>Strangest of all, seeming to stand guard beside the door
in the wall, stood two huge monkeys or apes large as dogs.
Their coats were marvelously beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Siberian squirrelskin,&rdquo; Jan whispered. &ldquo;Are they
real? Alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure!&rdquo; Gale moved back a step. &ldquo;I just saw one
blink his eye.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; said Jan. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do
more than eat me.&rdquo; She took two steps forward. The
&ldquo;Monkeys of the Snows&rdquo; followed her with their eyes, and
that was all.</p>
<p>She struck a large gong that hung beside the door. A
small, square window swung open, and like a Jack-in-the-box,
a round head popped out. A pair of small eyes stared
at them. A pair of lips said &ldquo;Pst!&rdquo; Then the head popped
back and the window closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Jan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo; Gale sat down on a big rock.</p>
<p>Jan tried to make friends with the magnificent apes
but they were indifferent to her charms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in their class,&rdquo; Gale laughed.</p>
<p>Moments dragged on. Then suddenly the door swung
wide. A little man in a wide robe stepped out, bowed low,
then said in perfect English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The humble accommodations of our poor temple are
at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;d like some tea,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have tea and hot rice cakes. Then, if you
wish, you may rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The monkeys,&rdquo; he added, noting Gale&rsquo;s look of apprehension,
&ldquo;are harmless. They are great pets. No animals
are ever harmed here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we too,&rdquo; he smiled broadly, &ldquo;are harmless. Our
only wish is to serve. And to serve ladies of your rank
from the land that is to free our land, China,&mdash;ah! That
is a rare privilege.&rdquo; He led the way into the temple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;You came a long way to see our temple. We are highly
honored,&rdquo; said the monk when they were all three seated
at a plain board table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we didn&rsquo;t come to see your temple,&rdquo; Jan volunteered.
&ldquo;We&mdash;&rdquo; she caught Gale&rsquo;s eye, then stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a mission that takes us farther into the
mountains,&rdquo; Gale stated simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; The monk stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are soldiers.&rdquo; Gale squared her shoulders. &ldquo;Soldiers
go where they are sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! But to go into dangerous country unescorted
when protection is to be had, that is regrettable.&rdquo; There
was a kind, fatherly quality in the man&rsquo;s voice that Gale
liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives can&rsquo;t be so terrible,&rdquo; said Jan. &ldquo;A tribe
of them carried our car around a washout for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. The natives, they will not harm you. I can
give you a sign that will take you safely through any
native village in these mountains. But the wild beasts,
that is different. Only last week a rogue elephant visited
a village and tore down the houses. The week before, a
child was carried away by a man-eating tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale studied the man&rsquo;s face. Was he, she wondered,
trying to frighten them? She doubted that. Could he be
told of their mission? She did not know. Fortunately he
was to provide the answers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your tea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The cakes will be here in
a moment. Will you drink tea with me?&rdquo; They drank in
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are friends. Nothing that I can do
for you shall remain undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Gale, &ldquo;tell us, has a tall, gorgeously
dressed woman visited this temple in the last three days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! There you have me!&rdquo; The monk&rsquo;s eyes flickered.
&ldquo;This temple is a place of refuge for all. I am not free to
tell who comes and who goes. You might remain here for
a month and no one would know.&rdquo; This speech set Gale
back on her heels. If she could not ask a simple question
and get an answer from this man, what could she expect?
They ate their cakes and drank a second cup of tea in
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not leave our house in silence.&rdquo; Their host
seemed genuinely disturbed. &ldquo;Come. Let me tell you a
little. I have lived and studied in America. America is my
foster-mother. I love her for that, and because she has
come to the aid of my first mother, China. Listen?&rdquo; He
held up a hand.</p>
<p>They caught the low drone of a distant airplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is one gateway to Burma. The pass is
over yonder among the clouds. More than one of your
brave fighters has fallen among those jagged crags, and
not a few have been rescued by our monks or by the natives
who gladly aid them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Gale breathed softly. Hope had flamed in her
heart. &ldquo;Has&mdash;has one been rescued lately?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not within a month,&rdquo; was the quiet reply. Hope fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if one has fallen,&rdquo; came after a brief silence. The
monk did not finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! One has been lost,&rdquo; Gale exclaimed softly,
throwing caution to the wind. &ldquo;A very good friend of mine
is down at the place they call Hell&rsquo;s Half Hour. We have
come to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you two came alone to find him?&rdquo; Fresh surprise,
not unmixed with admiration, was written on the man&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Then I beg of you, allow me to assist you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, when the two girls again took up the trail,
four monks, one of them a Chinese doctor of some ability,
went with them.</p>
<p>As they came to the crest of a ridge overlooking the
temple, Gale was surprised to see the extent of the grounds.
Besides the main building, there were many others, some
small and some quite large. She recalled the words of the
head monk: &ldquo;You could live here for a month and no one
would know.&rdquo; Then she thought of the Woman in Purple,
and shuddered.</p>
<p>They had tramped for two hours up the jungle trail
when one of their guides gave a grunt, then motioned for
silence.</p>
<p>Out of the profound, mystery-laden silence came a
strange sound&mdash;the distant roll of a drum. The drumbeats
were measured and spaced. They came to an end, only to
begin again. From time to time the guide spoke in Chinese
to the doctor. At last Gale could stand it no longer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean? Tell me!&rdquo; she begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend has been found. He is far in the heart of
the jungle and has been injured,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you know that?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drums, they have told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drums?&rdquo; Gale stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the natives in these hills are our friends,&rdquo; the
doctor explained. &ldquo;When a flier falls near a village they
do all they can for him. Then, on the signal drums they
beat out a message in code all their own. Other villages
take up the story. In the end, it reaches us. Our guide
understands the code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come. We must hasten,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;They are bringing
your friend out of the jungle. We must go to meet
them. We shall do what we can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>Count Your Men, Tojo</i></span></h2>
<p>In the brightening dawn of that eventful day Isabelle
watched Pete ride away leading the big push, atop his
tank. She saw him cross the bridge that only a few hours
before had not been there, then follow the river along the
opposite side, only to cross and re-cross the river, then to
vanish into the great unknown.</p>
<p>Overhead three Jap planes appeared. There came a
roar from the hills. American planes went swooping down.
A short, sharp fight, and the Jap planes vanished.</p>
<p>And the procession moved steadily forward. After the
tanks came guns, and after these an endless procession of
trucks loaded with men and equipment. After these, most
impressive of all, came marching men, thousands of them.
Rifles and Tommy-guns over shoulders, pack on backs,
they tramped steadily forward.</p>
<p>Isabelle swallowed hard as she whispered, &ldquo;God, this is
too much. Why must all this happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Than Shwe was dancing. &ldquo;The people of Burma,
my people, are starving. The Japs have taken all the rice.
But now they shall be set free. They shall eat again. See,
Isabelle, tanks, guns, men and Tommy-guns! The colonel
fetched out a Tommy-gun on his shoulder. Now we have
thousands of Tommy-guns. It is beautiful and wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;And terrible,&rdquo; Isabelle murmured. For all that, she was
thrilled as never before. It was strange.</p>
<p>With Isabelle&rsquo;s rose tightly gripped in his teeth Pete
rode on into the dawn.</p>
<p>They came at last to enemy territory. Here the road
was old and quite rough. But still they rumbled on.</p>
<p>They went several miles without a shot being fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this.&rdquo; Pete took the rose from between
his lips to consult the captain of his tank. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of
ominous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like moving pictures of them frontier days,&rdquo; Bud
Rankin, the tank&rsquo;s boss, agreed. &ldquo;Indians lyin&rsquo; for you on
the edge of some river bank, an&rsquo; all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Sure!&rdquo; Pete agreed, sticking the rose in his cap
as if it were a red feather. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some kind of a track going over that clay bank.
Let&rsquo;s have a look.&rdquo; They had gone into the lead of the
other tanks by several hundred feet.</p>
<p>Quickly climbing down, he made a running leap and
was atop the clay bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man! Oh man!&rdquo; he exclaimed softly. &ldquo;Track of a
giant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he raced back to mount the tank once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bud,&rdquo; he spoke in a low tone, leaning far over, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
the track of a giant tank. Alongside of that tank ours is
just a baby. The Japs never made that tank. It came all the
way from Hitlerland. They&rsquo;ve been dodging our blockade,
bringing in guns and tanks and taking out rubber and
tin. They must have brought these tanks, maybe a whole
shipload.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about that!&rdquo; Bud exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hang around behind these banks, then come
up and blast us,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get them first.
Wait. I&rsquo;ll have one more look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he streaked up the bank. He dropped flat when
he reached the top, then crept forward. A moment later
Bud saw him hold up three fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of them!&rdquo; Bud groaned, speaking to his engineer.
&ldquo;Three giants. What now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Pete returned, his strategy was all worked out.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re German Mark Sixes,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Sixty ton
babies. But what do we care for that? This here gun of
ours can shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you sure can lay &rsquo;em down in the groove,&rdquo; said
Bud, who was from the Kentucky mountains. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the
gunshootinest feller I most ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I am,&rdquo; Pete agreed. &ldquo;Now look! This is the way
it is. The ground is level about half a mile farther up.
They&rsquo;re waitin&rsquo; up there to blast us. We&rsquo;ll climb right
up the next ridge behind these little low trees and we&rsquo;ll
give them the surprise of their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you, Pete. Let&rsquo;s ramble.&rdquo; Bud agreed.</p>
<p>So with the red rose still in his cap, Pete again mounted
the tank and directed its course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>When they started up the bank the treads began to slip
but increased power drove them forward until at last they
stood at the crest. There Pete squinted through low trees
for a space of seconds. Then tumbling down into the tank
he dropped the door softly, swung his turret about,
squinted down the gun, moved the turret just a little,
squinted again, then exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something for you, Tojo!&rdquo; At that his gun
roared.</p>
<p>The smoke had not cleared before a second shot rang
out, and after that a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! Let&rsquo;s see!&rdquo; Shoving back the door, Pete climbed
to the turret top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Running like blazes,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We got &rsquo;em all
right. Now, Tojo! Count your men! Count your
men!&rdquo; He sent a hail of machine-gun fire after the fleeing
Japs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to move fast!&rdquo; Pete exclaimed, once more
popping out of the tank&rsquo;s top. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the next one.
Slide her up a bit.&rdquo; The General Sherman rumbled forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! Stop her!&rdquo; He tumbled back into the tank and
in ten seconds had his gun in action. The second shot resulted
in a tremendous roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blowed up. That Mark Six blowed right up,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you know about that? Come on! Let&rsquo;s
ramble again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like some rogue elephant roaming the hills, the third
big tank had rambled from sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; Pete exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone and lost himself!
We&rsquo;ll have to hunt him up. There&rsquo;s a higher hill.
Let&rsquo;s roll up there for a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rolled to the crest of the hill. Pete was about to
pop out for a look around when an enemy shell saved him
the trouble of lifting the tank&rsquo;s lid. The shell blew the
lid off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Red Dynamite!&rdquo; Pete exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lost
his lid! Oh, well, I never did think much of that lid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust up his head for a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out! You&rsquo;ll git it too!&rdquo; Bud warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lightnin&rsquo; never strikes twice in the same place,&rdquo; said
Pete, climbing half way up for a better look. &ldquo;Neither do
Tojo&rsquo;s shells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This might be true, but it would seem that the Japs
are good at near misses, for just then a shell whizzed past
him so close that the suction almost dragged him from the
tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! You dirty&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short. After dropping
back into the tank, he put up a hand. His cap was gone
and with it Isabelle&rsquo;s rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do that to me!&rdquo; he stormed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big
field gun. I saw where that shell came from. Let me at
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one held him back. He squinted once, then fired
three shells in quick succession.</p>
<p>There came no reply from the enemy. &ldquo;Got him!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;Now maybe I can enjoy a little fresh air.&rdquo; He
climbed back to the tank&rsquo;s shattered top.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>In the meantime three other U. S. tanks had cornered
the remaining giant enemy and proceeded to beat him into
submission.</p>
<p>And so as the grand parade proceeded to spread itself
out over the landscape, the battle went on.</p>
<p>And far away in the wilds the native drums told their
story over and over while Gale and Jan moved ever closer
to their goal.</p>
<p>At last, an hour before sunset, a weird sound began
drifting through the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Gale asked, pausing to rest her tired body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the native marching chant,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;They
are coming. Soon they will be with us. We may wait
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tired as she was, Gale could not wait. Hurrying forward,
she met the dusky caravan with Jimmie carried on a
litter in their midst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Are you badly injured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale!&rdquo; he exclaimed in astonishment. &ldquo;Are you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Why not? I heard your call and I came. I hear you
calling, calling me,&rdquo; she chanted.</p>
<p>Needless to say the native marchers were given a rest
while Jimmie and Gale made up for lost time in certain
little matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jimmie, are you badly injured?&rdquo; she repeated at
last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be flying again soon, and I&rsquo;d better be,&rdquo; was his
reply. &ldquo;The colonel must be half way across Burma by
now. And don&rsquo;t forget, we have a date. Our destination is
Tokio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jimmie! You must take me with you!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surely will, if I have to kidnap you!&rdquo; he vowed.</p>
<p>Arrived at the spot where the monks were busy preparing
a camp for the night, they rested while tea was brewed
and some sort of wild meat was roasted over the fire.</p>
<p>Jungle dinner over, the doctor took charge of Jimmie.
He discovered an arm out of its socket, a cracked rib, and a
badly bruised leg that, after all, was not broken. When
these injuries had been cared for, they all rolled up in their
blankets and slept while dusky forms took turns at watching
through the night.</p>
<p>Just after dark on that same day Pete came bursting
into the colonel&rsquo;s temporary headquarters, a deserted roadside
store&mdash;a full fifty miles inside Burma.</p>
<p>Isabelle, who sat typing orders, looked up wearily to
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you want to see&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off short to exclaim,
&ldquo;Pete! It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; Pete grinned. &ldquo;The colonel sent for me.
He wants to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he? Then come on in here.&rdquo; She led him to an
improvised washroom where a wooden tub full of water
awaited him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dust an inch thick on your face and caked with blood
at that,&rdquo; she grumbled. &ldquo;And your hair&rsquo;s a mess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;They blowed my hat off and my rose! Blast &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that. Duck your head,&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
<p>When she had scrubbed his neck and hair she rubbed
him down good with a coarse towel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; she exclaimed, laughing, &ldquo;the colonel can really
see you. He wants to congratulate you and pin a medal
on you for being the best gunner of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! Isabelle! It was nothing!&rdquo; he said with a grin.
&ldquo;It was just because they made me mad, blowing away
my rose the way they did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Isabelle,&rdquo; he squared off for a good look, &ldquo;you sure
are one swell gal. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if we&rsquo;d have a lot
of dates when we get back home. Maybe we&rsquo;ll have so
many we&rsquo;ll just decide to move in together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Isabelle, &ldquo;will be just swell.&rdquo; And to prove
she meant it, she sealed the bargain with something better
than a handshake.</p>
<p>After that they hunted up the colonel to collect Pete&rsquo;s
medal, which to Pete, considering what had happened
before, was practically nothing at all. And so the war
went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>The Fiery Cross</i></span></h2>
<p>It required all the next day to bring Jimmie by slow
stages down the rough mountain trail to the temple. There
they were given a real treat, some rare vegetable soup,
rice bread and such fruit salads as they had never tasted
before.</p>
<p>When Jimmie had been put to rest for the night, Gale
and Jan were shown to their room. There they found comfortable
beds and blankets of virgin wool to keep out the
night&rsquo;s chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;This is better than army life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was better, Gale admitted that to herself. She was
tired too. It seemed she must fall asleep at once, but she
did not. The days that had just passed had been too exciting
for that. Besides, within her being was a feeling of
vague uneasiness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s some sort of a forewarning of evil,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt it before when something terrible
threatened.&rdquo; She had learned many strange signs and
tokens from the old black mammy who cared for her as
a child.</p>
<p>At last she whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;Jan! Jan! Are you
asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Of course not,&rdquo; was Jan&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
I hear you tumbling about?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Gale laughed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s slip into our jackets
and slacks and slip out on the trail. We&rsquo;ll walk off the
strong tea we drank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you say.&rdquo; Jan tumbled out of bed.</p>
<p>There was a watchman at the main gate, but at the back
was a narrow hole in the wall that was not locked. With
a pinpoint light they made their way through this gate,
then along the wall to the main trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan,&rdquo; Gale whispered. &ldquo;I wish the war was over right
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; was the quick reply. &ldquo;The whole world
is waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it was over I&rsquo;d stay right here for a month,&rdquo; said
Gale. &ldquo;Think what fun it would be studying the birds, the
gorgeous butterflies, the monkeys and everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, everything,&rdquo; Jan laughed softly. &ldquo;Rogue elephants,
man-eating tigers, mad water-buffalo! No! No! Let
me out, PDQ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Gale whispered. &ldquo;I think I hear a plane.&rdquo; By
this time they were some distance from the temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. I suppose a lot of our planes cross over the pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; Gale warned. &ldquo;I do hear planes, more than
one, but they are far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they tramped in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those planes are coming closer,&rdquo; Gale murmured.
&ldquo;The sound is strange, not quite like a squadron of our
own ships. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;Up there ahead in that open
space that&rsquo;s like a clearing! There&rsquo;s a queer light! Come
on! Let&rsquo;s have a look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their rubber shoes making no sound, they sped forward
to a bend in the trail. Then they saw it. A figure bending
over a long stretch of flames in the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a woman,&rdquo; Gale whispered excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A monk,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>Woman or monk the figure darted into the brush.</p>
<p>And then the two girls saw it&mdash;a large, fiery cross burning
in the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some religious fanatic did it,&rdquo; said Jan, &ldquo;someone who
doesn&rsquo;t like the Buddhists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; Gale sprang forward. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
signal fire for those planes. See! The cross points toward
the temple. It&rsquo;s the Woman in Purple!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; She sprang to one side of the trail where some
ancient pine trees stood. &ldquo;This mass of moss and pine
needles is damp from recent rains. Grab a big armful
and come on! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirty seconds later they were hovering over the flames,
burying them under sodden masses of debris. &ldquo;That fire
is made of pine cones. How it burns!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s half out. Bring more!&rdquo; Gale exploded. &ldquo;They may
come back. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll stand guard.&rdquo; She drew out her small
automatic.</p>
<p>Jan raced away to return again and yet again. The fire
was almost out when Gale heard a sound in the brush.
Like a flash she fired a shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>Jan came running. &ldquo;Did&mdash;did you see someone?&rdquo; she
panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I heard them,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s steady reply. &ldquo;After
I fired there was a sound like a low cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look!&rdquo; Before Gale could stop her Jan sprang
into the brush.</p>
<p>She was gone a long time. Gale was about to despair
when suddenly she reappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t find a thing. Got good and scratched by briars,&rdquo;
said Jan. &ldquo;Oh yes! Just this. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; She held out a bit
of thin cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purple!&rdquo; Gale whispered.</p>
<p>The planes were close now, circling like wild geese
looking for a landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for the light to guide them,&rdquo; said Gale. &ldquo;They
meant to destroy the temple.&rdquo; &ldquo;And us.&rdquo; Jan shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure! They&rsquo;d like to get us and Jimmie and they
hate the temple because the monks help to rescue our airmen.
But they&rsquo;ll never find the temple now,&rdquo; Gale added.
&ldquo;On a night like this it cannot be seen from the sky. The
monks should know about this,&rdquo; said Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Gale agreed. &ldquo;You go hurry back and
tell them. I&rsquo;ll stand guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that gun.&rdquo; Jan put out a hand. &ldquo;I can shoot
as straight as you can. Besides, I could handle that woman
and her black dwarf with one hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; Gale hesitated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the contents
of her toilet case.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; Jan breathed. &ldquo;A gun and a dagger! All the
same, I&rsquo;m staying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. Here&rsquo;s the gun. I&rsquo;ll be back before you know
it.&rdquo; Gale was away.</p>
<p>As Jan stood there in the shadows waiting, listening, she
caught all manner of strange sounds. A bird whistled in
its sleep. There came a chattering. Then came the sound
of monkeys racing through trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you going to know what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; she breathed
with a shudder. &ldquo;They could spring at you from the dark
and you&rsquo;d never know&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts were broken into for from the distance
came heavy tramping footsteps. They sounded louder
second by second. Then down the trail a vast form moved.
Jan dived silently into the brush as a huge elephant went
lumbering past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope Gale got there,&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>Gale was at the temple. She had roused the head of
the household, the little man with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely believe you,&rdquo; he said when her story
was told. &ldquo;Yet I must believe. Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rang a bell. A monk appeared. The Superior said
a few words in Chinese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must send someone to relieve your friend.&rdquo; The
Superior rang his bell three times. Three monks appeared.
He spoke to them in Chinese. They departed on the run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have no guns,&rdquo; said the Superior. &ldquo;Nevertheless
we have our manner of handling such things,&rdquo; he added
in a mysterious whisper. &ldquo;This will not happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the first monk returned to report. When
he had finished the Superior turned again to Gale. &ldquo;You
are right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A woman who dresses always in
purple has been our guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; the girl breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had a servant, a black dwarf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Superior held up a hand. &ldquo;There is little that we
can do now. Their lodgings are empty. They have departed,
taking all their belongings with them. There are
many trails. Should we overtake them, there is nothing we
could do. We are not the law, only humble monks striving
to make the people of this earth a little happier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; He held up a hand. The droning sound of
motors was fading away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are gone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have done us a great
service. I shall send a message to the Superior of all
temples along the way to treat you as a sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;our temple will be guarded
at night. Three brothers will watch this night through.
You may sleep in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale and Jan did sleep in peace. Early next morning
four monks took up Jimmie&rsquo;s litter and carried him before
the girls down the mountain to their jeep.</p>
<p>There they wove him a hammock of ropes that fitted
across the back of the car. The girls thanked them, bade
them goodbye and drove away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Early that same evening Jimmie found himself in a
bed at the hospital beneath the shadows of the Secret
Forest with the gentle doll-like Mai-da as his nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be off in the morning,&rdquo; said Gale as she
sat beside him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that the colonel and his army are
half way across Burma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took the Japs by surprise,&rdquo; Jimmie laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
great. He&rsquo;ll be in China before we know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; Gale agreed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be setting up a
more or less permanent base there, and I must be there to
guard him with my radar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Mac,&rdquo; he teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Sure,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;Mac is grand. But Jimmie,&rdquo;
her voice dropped, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a one-time flying Tiger who
will be in all my dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s swell,&rdquo; Jimmie beamed. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t forget, that
one-timer will be along before you know it. Then you&rsquo;ll
have to keep a date over Tokio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jimmie!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Do you really believe
you can fix it that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo; He shook a finger at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the
grandest little fixer you ever met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, next day at dawn, Gale and Jan in their jeep
rattled away toward the battle front and fresh adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>This Is It!</i></span></h2>
<p>For many days after that, out on the battle front, life for
the American forces was an almost monotonous succession
of victories. Taken by surprise, the small force of Japs
defending their foothold in Burma were pushed back,
back, back by the colonel&rsquo;s onrushing army. They reached
the Chinese border and rolled right on. Great forces of
Chinese fighters, hungry, ragged, ill armed but eager,
joined in the battle. Great convoys of trucks laden with
food, clothing, rifles, Tommy-guns and ammunition for
these fighters rolled in a never-ending stream over the
colonel&rsquo;s road.</p>
<p>The colonel set up temporary headquarters in an abandoned
ranch house, a bomb-shattered store, the home of a
rich Chinese merchant, and at last in a small but beautiful
temple.</p>
<p>Always the team of Gale and Mac were on hand to
watch the skies for enemy bombers. Since the days were
bright they did their work only at night. Twice Gale
spotted oncoming marauders, twice Mac, and night-fighting
U. S. planes blasted them from the skies.</p>
<p>Jan stuck to her jeep. She was always at the colonel&rsquo;s
service. At times she drove the colonel about, at others she
did some rough riding with tough buck privates, and enjoyed
it. &ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; she would exclaim as she came in covered
with sweat, dust and grease, &ldquo;this is the life! It really is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Yes, for Gale and Jan life took on a definite pattern.
Then, as often happens in war, that pattern was suddenly
torn into small bits.</p>
<p>It started when one day the colonel called Gale to his
headquarters to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been on night work for some time now. You
need a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll like the change I am offering you.&rdquo; A
strange smile played about his lips. &ldquo;I have a friend who
has just arrived at the airfield. I think perhaps he has
some sort of proposition to make you. You have my permission
to accept. His name&mdash;&rdquo; A smile spread over his
face, &ldquo;is Jimmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie?&rdquo; She sprang to her feet. &ldquo;Is he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s back in the saddle. Your old pal Jan is waiting
outside. I suggest that you go for a ride with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten seconds later as Gale tumbled into Jan&rsquo;s jeep
she exclaimed. &ldquo;The airfield, James! And make it
snappy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later Gale and Jimmie were drinking hot
black coffee in a cubbyhole just off of the airfield where
they could talk in absolute secrecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Gale,&rdquo; Jimmie&rsquo;s smile was strange. &ldquo;You asked
for it. Now you&rsquo;ll have to take it or leave it. I&rsquo;ve got it all
arranged. Don&rsquo;t ask me how, just tell me yes or no.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; she stared at him in silence for a space
of seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you get me.&rdquo; His face sobered. &ldquo;If your answer
is yes&mdash;and I&rsquo;m no one to blame you if it&rsquo;s no, for at best
it&rsquo;s a rather dangerous mission&mdash;all you have to do is to
dress up in these,&rdquo; he placed a hand on a large rubber-wrapped
bundle, &ldquo;and meet me here at dawn.&rdquo; He removed
his hand from the bundle. Her hand took its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo; His hand closed over hers. &ldquo;Then we fly
at dawn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jimmie!&rdquo; Her voice was husky. &ldquo;And Jimmie, if
our ship gets it, if we&rsquo;re headed for earth&rsquo;s last checkout,
the last roundup, you know, what shall we say? &lsquo;Here
goes nothing&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Gale.&rdquo; His face sobered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I used
to think of it. It&rsquo;s a grand gesture, but you can&rsquo;t hold it.
I tried it once when I thought my time had come. You
can&rsquo;t stick it. No one can at the last second, for you see
it&rsquo;s not really nothing that&rsquo;s going from the earth. It&rsquo;s
YOU, and you suddenly decide that you don&rsquo;t want to go&mdash;that
you really want terribly to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what you mean,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;All
right, Jimmie.&rdquo; She stood up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you at dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes after that dawn Gale found herself on
board the most gorgeous four-motored bomber she had
ever seen. Jimmie was at the stick and she frantically at
work studying the ship&rsquo;s radar set, teaching herself in one
short hour all she needed to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>From time to time Jimmie glanced back, and if she was
not looking, grinned wisely. Once he turned to his co-pilot
and winked. That was all. And so for a full three quarters
of an hour they flew on.</p>
<p>At last with her head in a whirl, Gale took time out
for a glance at the scenery that lay beyond and beneath
them. Then lips parted, she stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; she exclaimed, racing to his side. &ldquo;This is
not the way to Tokio! Those are the mountains up ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says this is the way to Tokio?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are&mdash;aren&rsquo;t we going to bomb Tokio?&rdquo; She felt a terrible
vacancy where her heart should have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Why sure we are!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;when we get
around to it. But this is a pickup crew and you are one of
them. Just now we&rsquo;re headed for the Secret Forest and at
least five days of good, tough practice.&rdquo; He laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie, you&rsquo;re a bad boy!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Just for
that I have a mind to take a jump and walk back to my
colonel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t do that for worlds,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just take
it easy. We&rsquo;ll make it to Tokio yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale did take it easy, all she could. So did the rest of
the crew for everyone of them had known the restful peace
of the Secret Forest and not a man of them but knew the
gamble with life that lay before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>There was work aplenty. First flying as a crew, co-ordinating
their every movement, and then as a member
of a large formation they prepared themselves for the final
ordeal.</p>
<p>One morning Gale arrived on the field to find the land
crews loading bombs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo; she said to Jimmie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; was his reply. That was all. In half an
hour they were off on the great adventure.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>If life had been strange and fascinating for Gale, it
had been scarcely less so for her friends, Isabelle, Jan
and Than Shwe. The same morning Gale left the colonel
called them into his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been working hard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gale has just
left on a&mdash;well, you might say a change of scene. I want
you to take a leave. What&rsquo;s more, I want you to see what
we&rsquo;re fighting for here in China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; said Isabelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have the opportunity,&rdquo; said the colonel. &ldquo;The
home of your friend, the little Chinese nurse, Mai-da, is
only a short way from here. She has just arrived at the
front and would like to take you there for a few days. How
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Golly! That will be keen!&rdquo; were
the responses he received.</p>
<p>And so it happened that in Jan&rsquo;s jeep they all rattled
away to learn in a few short lessons what life could be
like in China.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Mai-da&rsquo;s was one of the truly old families of China.
The high wall that surrounded it was more than three
hundred years old. Inside were no great mansions but
many small houses. Though in peace time seventy people
lived here everyone had a little place all his own.</p>
<p>To Jan their strange customs, eating rice with chop-sticks,
gathering at night to hear the aged grandfather
read from the Chinese classics, and their curious religious
customs were amusing. But to Isabelle, who was interested
in the life lived by all the people of the world, this seemed
a charming interlude in the midst of a great and terrible
war.</p>
<p>They were not, however, to be free from the war for
long. On the fifth day of their stay, with the remark that
her jeep was getting rheumatism in its joints, Jan drove
back for an hour&rsquo;s visit at camp. She had not been gone
long when just at twilight from the west came the roar of
heavy planes. No one paid any attention at first, believing
them to be American planes.</p>
<p>All of a sudden Isabelle, who had given much time to
the study of airplane spotting, sprang up with a cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are enemy bombers, and they are headed this
way!&rdquo; Something seemed to tell her that this home that
had stood so long was to be the target of those bombers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll bomb his place,&rdquo; she exclaimed, scarcely knowing
why she said it. &ldquo;We should all escape into the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Why? Why?&rdquo; came from every side. But
having more than once witnessed the terror of the Jap&rsquo;s
fury, they all raced away into the hills. There, sitting on
the sloping side of a deep gully, they waited the coming
of terror from the sky.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt but that Isabelle&rsquo;s advice saved
their lives, for flying straight as swallows, three heavy
bombers sped across the sky to at last go sweeping in a
wide circle and drop their loads of hate on the defenseless
homes.</p>
<p>Women wept, children screamed, and old men gnashed
their teeth as they saw the small homes leap into the air,
then burst into flames.</p>
<p>Just when the home was burning fiercest and the
sound of bombers was fading into the night that had
fallen, Jan came rattling up the hill.</p>
<p>Seeing the plight they were all in, she said never a
word, but gathering two small children who had learned
to love her into her arms, sat down in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that woman,&rdquo; said the aged grandfather. &ldquo;She was
seen only yesterday at the home where her friend the war
lord lived. It is she who set these bombers upon us.&rdquo; He
spoke in Chinese, but Mai-da translated his speech for
Isabelle and Jan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What woman does he mean?&rdquo; Isabelle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is the one you call the Woman in Purple,&rdquo; was
Mai-da&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Isabelle cried in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped she was dead!&rdquo; Jan exclaimed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s too bad
to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old grandfather was speaking again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is a small dark man with her. Wherever this
pair goes destruction follows. She has caused the destruction
of a thousand homes and the death of many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabelle!&rdquo; Jan sprang up. &ldquo;Know what? Gale&rsquo;s radar
set is gone! It was stolen from headquarters! That woman
took it! We&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to get it back! Don&rsquo;t forget, Three
Secrets of Radar. She must not keep that set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this war lord&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; she demanded of
Mai-da.</p>
<p>Mai-da pointed to a house half a mile away where a
small square of light shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Isabelle exclaimed, lifting Jan to her feet,
then seizing a rifle brought to the scene by the grandfather.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get that radar set. Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing what she was doing, Isabelle marched
away beside her stout and resolute companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><i>This Is Tokio</i></span></h2>
<p>Without any definite plan of attack, and not once
looking back, the two girls trudged up the hill leading to
the large house built in the American style.</p>
<p>They had just reached the top of a flight of steps leading
to the lawn when all of a sudden a door leading to a
second story balcony flew open, releasing a flood of light.
In this light stood a tall, handsome woman and a diminutive
black dwarf.</p>
<p>Reaching for the light brought Jan and Isabelle out
in full relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you wanted to see me again?&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s voice
was full of scorn. &ldquo;Well, take a good look.&rdquo; She held out
a long blue automatic. In his hands the dwarf clutched
a rifle. Jan&rsquo;s heart sank. She was not even sure her rifle
was loaded. &ldquo;Take a good long look,&rdquo; the woman repeated.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember that you saw a handsome woman as
you draw your last breath.&rdquo; She laughed hoarsely.</p>
<p>At that instant Isabelle heard a sound behind her but
dared not look back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take the fat one, Paedro,&rdquo; Isabelle heard the
woman say. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good mark for you. I could kill a bird
at that distance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>Isabelle&rsquo;s blood ran cold. As the black dwarf lifted his
rifle she thought of flight but her feet would not move.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden from behind her something set
up a tremendous clatter. As if she were watching a movie
she saw the woman and her dwarf tumble in a heap. Then
the bright light blinked out, leaving all in darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan!&rdquo; Isabelle cried. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shot them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of Than Shwe who spoke. She was
standing behind them. In her hand was a smoking
Tommy-gun. &ldquo;I shot them,&rdquo; she repeated in a cool even
tone. &ldquo;They deserved to die. They brought death to
hundreds of my people. They would have killed you. I
saw you go, so I came too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Than Shwe! Where did you get that Tommy-gun?&rdquo;
Jan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This?&rdquo; The little nurse held the gun up proudly.
&ldquo;This is the Tommy-gun the colonel carried out of Burma
on his shoulder. When I came to Mai-da&rsquo;s house he let me
take it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I go get Gale&rsquo;s radar set.&rdquo; With her
gun across her shoulder she marched away.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later she returned, lugging the set. &ldquo;They
are quite dead. That is good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We will tell the
Army Intelligence. When they see what is in that house
they will say I am a very good girl. She was a very bad
spy, that woman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Next morning at dawn a squad of U. S. engineers with
a hundred Chinese workmen appeared at Mai-da&rsquo;s home
prepared to rebuild it. And at that same dawn Jimmie and
Gale tuned up their bombing plane to join their flight of
forty big ships bound for Tokio.</p>
<p>They dropped down half way to Tokio to take on gas,
then sped on their way.</p>
<p>It was a glorious day, with white clouds floating high.
The beauty and peace of the land far beneath them told
nothing of war.</p>
<p>As they came closer to the sea, clouds thickened. Soon
they were passing through miles of gray mist.</p>
<p>Gale, busy with her instrument, feeling for danger here,
there and everywhere, suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airplanes almost straight ahead; lower down than we
are; ten miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gale! You must be wrong!&rdquo; Jimmie exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Gale insisted. And it was right there that
the girl earned her passage.</p>
<p>Jimmie lowered his plane, altered his direction, slowed
down, then popped out of a cloud almost upon three Jap
scouting planes. Had the pilots of these planes been given
thirty seconds of life Tokio must have been warned.
Thirty seconds was denied them. Cannons and machine
guns raked them from engine to tail, and down they
went, one, two, three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo; Jimmie said. &ldquo;That will get you a medal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a medal,&rdquo; was Gale&rsquo;s quick reply. &ldquo;Show
me Tokio. That&rsquo;s all I ask.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>In half an hour her request was granted. They came
out of a cloud to see a great city bathed in bright sunshine.
Smoke rolled from factories making airplanes, tanks and
guns for destroying American boys. Trains sped away
with their loads of hate. All the city was busy and perhaps
happy. Who knows?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Jimmie, &ldquo;is Tokio and yonder is our
target.&rdquo; He nodded toward an airfield where a hundred
planes resting on the runways tossed back the sun-light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful! Glorious! Great stuff!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he
set his big ship roaring over the field.</p>
<p>At just the right second bombs began to drop. &ldquo;One,
two, three, four, five,&rdquo;&mdash;Gale found herself counting as
they fell among the Jap bombers and exploded with such
force that whole planes were blown into the sky to explode
there like rockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready!&rdquo; Jimmie warned his gunners, &ldquo;here come
the Jap fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the gunners stiffened at their posts Gale took up a
post that would permit her to replace any man in the body
of the ship who fell.</p>
<p>A Zero plane came in so close that she saw the leer on
the pilot&rsquo;s face. Receiving a burst of fire, he faded
from her sight. But on they came,&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four,
a whole squadron wheeled into view.</p>
<p>Cannons roared, machineguns rattled. The din was a
terrible thing to hear. Little planes went whirling down,
but still they came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>All of a sudden the right waist-gunner wavered at his
post, then fell like an empty sack. As if indeed he were
just that, Gale dragged him aside, seized his gun, looked
to its loading, then stood ready.</p>
<p>A plane flashed past, too far and too fast. It wheeled
to come shooting straight at her. Had the pilot contemplated
suicide? If so, it was his last thought. Her gun
spoke. He crumpled in his place, his engine died, then his
plane went whirling down.</p>
<p>But here was another. Approaching with caution, this
pilot swung to the right, then sent out a burst of small
slugs from a free machine gun. Gale felt a push at her left
shoulder. But her eye was on the target. She did not waver
but allowing for the enemy&rsquo;s speed, placed her shots before
him. His ship began to smoke, then exploded in mid
air.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden everything faded into gray fog.
Jimmie had headed his plane into a huge cloud that lay
on the road home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he said to the co-pilot. &ldquo;Take the stick. I&rsquo;ll look
things over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already two men were working over the fallen gunner.
Jimmie counted his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One casualty,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo; Then his
eyes fell on Gale who was sitting beside her gun. Catching
a suspicious blotch of red, he tore at her blouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hit!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; Her eyes opened wide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know you are, you little fool!&rdquo; he exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I feel fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, throwing out a blanket. &ldquo;Lie down
there. Here&rsquo;s a roll for a pillow. Now! Let me have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unbuttoning the blouse, he shoved it aside. &ldquo;Shoulder,&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;Not so bad. How&rsquo;s the bone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know? I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no don&rsquo;t move. I&rsquo;ll just fix it up a bit. I&rsquo;m no
doctor. Little first aid, that&rsquo;s all. But boy! If it had been
a little lower there&rsquo;d have been a dead WAC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jimmie Nightingale would have been in disgrace
for letting a WAC get killed,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now he&rsquo;ll get another medal,&rdquo; she teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will you, dam&mdash;I mean dum it. You&rsquo;ll get it if
I have to make it out of a coin I took from a dead Jap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said as he finished his first aid, &ldquo;I
suggest that you relax and forget. There&rsquo;ll be no more
Japs on our trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relax and forget,&rdquo; she whispered to herself. How
could she ever do that. Relax, yes, but forget, never!
Never! She did not even want to forget. She had joined
the WACS, had asked for active service, and had gotten
it in good measure. Who ever would want to forget?</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, by the time they reached home
base she was more than half asleep. But there was an
ambulance waiting for her and in it, Jan and Than Shwe
to welcome her home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;Golly! Does it hurt much?&rdquo; Jan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; Than Shwe warned, &ldquo;Just relax and
try to forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There it was again,&mdash;&ldquo;relax and forget.&rdquo; Gale wanted
to scream just to let them know she was still very much
alive. But remembering that she was a patient, she did relax,
even though she did refuse to forget.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Army Intelligence found plenty to prove that the
Woman in Purple and the Black Dwarf were spies,&rdquo;
Isabelle said to Gale as she sat by her cot in the hospital
next day and told her story. &ldquo;They found two servants
who told them plenty more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good they&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; said Gale. &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; she
groaned, &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll be shipped off to some place to
convalesce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said a man&rsquo;s voice. It was the colonel
who had just come in. &ldquo;Well, you wanted to see Tokio.
You saw Tokio, so now you must pay your passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t be half bad,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you to
the Secret Forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely,&rdquo; Isabelle murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost be willing
to get myself shot to go there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have Than Shwe for your nurse and Jimmie to
fly you there. And, hmm, I&rsquo;ll give Jimmie a week&rsquo;s leave.
He&rsquo;s really earned it, and so have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very thoughtful.&rdquo; Gale gave him a grateful
smile. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure! Sure!&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;As soon as the doctor says
you&rsquo;re able.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
